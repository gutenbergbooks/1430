      Beautiful Stories from Shakespeare
    </h1>
    <h2>
      By E. Nesbit
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> <i>&ldquo;It may be said of Shakespeare, that from his works may be
      collected a system of civil and economical prudence. He has been imitated
      by all succeeding writers; and it may be doubted whether from all his
      successors more maxims of theoretical knowledge, or more rules of
      practical prudence can be collected than he alone has given to his
      country.&rdquo;</i>--Dr. SAMUEL JOHNSON.

    </p>
    <h4>
      <b>PREFACE</b>
    </h4>
    <p>
      The writings of Shakespeare have been justly termed &ldquo;the richest, the
      purest, the fairest, that genius uninspired ever penned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare instructed by delighting. His plays alone (leaving mere
      science out of the question), contain more actual wisdom than the whole
      body of English learning. He is the teacher of all good-- pity,
      generosity, true courage, love. His bright wit is cut out &ldquo;into little
      stars.&rdquo; His solid masses of knowledge are meted out in morsels and
      proverbs, and thus distributed, there is scarcely a corner of the
      English-speaking world to-day which he does not illuminate, or a cottage
      which he does not enrich. His bounty is like the sea, which, though often
      unacknowledged, is everywhere felt. As his friend, Ben Jonson, wrote of
      him, &ldquo;He was not of an age but for all time.&rdquo; He ever kept the highroad of
      human life whereon all travel. He did not pick out by-paths of feeling and
      sentiment. In his creations we have no moral highwaymen, sentimental
      thieves, interesting villains, and amiable, elegant adventuresses--no
      delicate entanglements of situation, in which the grossest images are
      presented to the mind disguised under the superficial attraction of style
      and sentiment. He flattered no bad passion, disguised no vice in the garb
      of virtue, trifled with no just and generous principle. While causing us
      to laugh at folly, and shudder at crime, he still preserves our love for
      our fellow-beings, and our reverence for ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare was familiar with all beautiful forms and images, with all
      that is sweet or majestic in the simple aspects of nature, of that
      indestructible love of flowers and fragrance, and dews, and clear
      waters--and soft airs and sounds, and bright skies and woodland solitudes,
      and moon-light bowers, which are the material elements of poetry,--and
      with that fine sense of their indefinable relation to mental emotion,
      which is its essence and vivifying soul--and which, in the midst of his
      most busy and tragical scenes, falls like gleams of sunshine on rocks and
      ruins--contrasting with all that is rugged or repulsive, and reminding us
      of the existence of purer and brighter elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things considered, what wonder is it that the works of Shakespeare,
      next to the Bible, are the most highly esteemed of all the classics of
      English literature. &ldquo;So extensively have the characters of Shakespeare
      been drawn upon by artists, poets, and writers of fiction,&rdquo; says an
      American author,--&ldquo;So interwoven are these characters in the great body of
      English literature, that to be ignorant of the plot of these dramas is
      often a cause of embarrassment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Shakespeare wrote for grown-up people, for men and women, and in words
      that little folks cannot understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence this volume. To reproduce the entertaining stories contained in the
      plays of Shakespeare, in a form so simple that children can understand and
      enjoy them, was the object had in view by the author of these Beautiful
      Stories from Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that the youngest readers may not stumble in pronouncing any
      unfamiliar names to be met with in the stories, the editor has prepared
      and included in the volume a Pronouncing Vocabulary of Difficult Names. To
      which is added a collection of Shakespearean Quotations, classified in
      alphabetical order, illustrative of the wisdom and genius of the world's
      greatest dramatist.

      <br /> <b><a name="life" id="life">A BRIEF LIFE OF SHAKESPEARE.</a></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the register of baptisms of the parish church of Stratford-upon-Avon, a
      market town in Warwickshire, England, appears, under date of April 26,
      1564, the entry of the baptism of William, the son of John Shakspeare. The
      entry is in Latin--&ldquo;Gulielmus filius Johannis Shakspeare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The date of William Shakespeare's birth has usually been taken as three
      days before his baptism, but there is certainly no evidence of this fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family name was variously spelled, the dramatist himself not always
      spelling it in the same way. While in the baptismal record the name is
      spelled &ldquo;Shakspeare,&rdquo; in several authentic autographs of the dramatist it
      reads &ldquo;Shakspere,&rdquo; and in the first edition of his works it is printed
      &ldquo;Shakespeare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halliwell tells us, that there are not less than thirty-four ways in which
      the various members of the Shakespeare family wrote the name, and in the
      council-book of the corporation of Stratford, where it is introduced one
      hundred and sixty-six times during the period that the dramatist's father
      was a member of the municipal body, there are fourteen different
      spellings. The modern &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; is not among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's father, while an alderman at Stratford, appears to have been
      unable to write his name, but as at that time nine men out of ten were
      content to make their mark for a signature, the fact is not specially to
      his discredit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traditions and other sources of information about the occupation of
      Shakespeare's father differ. He is described as a butcher, a woolstapler,
      and a glover, and it is not impossible that he may have been all of these
      simultaneously or at different times, or that if he could not properly be
      called any one of them, the nature of his occupation was such as to make
      it easy to understand how the various traditions sprang up. He was a
      landed proprietor and cultivator of his own land even before his marriage,
      and he received with his wife, who was Mary Arden, daughter of a country
      gentleman, the estate of Asbies, 56 acres in extent. William was the third
      child. The two older than he were daughters, and both probably died in
      infancy. After him was born three sons and a daughter. For ten or twelve
      years at least, after Shakespeare's birth his father continued to be in
      easy circumstances. In the year 1568 he was the high bailiff or chief
      magistrate of Stratford, and for many years afterwards he held the
      position of alderman as he had done for three years before. To the
      completion of his tenth year, therefore, it is natural to suppose that
      William Shakespeare would get the best education that Stratford could
      afford. The free school of the town was open to all boys and like all the
      grammar-schools of that time, was under the direction of men who, as
      graduates of the universities, were qualified to diffuse that sound
      scholarship which was once the boast of England. There is no record of
      Shakespeare's having been at this school, but there can be no rational
      doubt that he was educated there. His father could not have procured for
      him a better education anywhere. To those who have studied Shakespeare's
      works without being influenced by the old traditional theory that he had
      received a very narrow education, they abound with evidences that he must
      have been solidly grounded in the learning, properly so called, was taught
      in the grammar schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are local associations connected with Stratford which could not be
      without their influence in the formation of young Shakespeare's mind.
      Within the range of such a boy's curiosity were the fine old historic
      towns of Warwick and Coventry, the sumptuous palace of Kenilworth, the
      grand monastic remains of Evesham. His own Avon abounded with spots of
      singular beauty, quiet hamlets, solitary woods. Nor was Stratford shut out
      from the general world, as many country towns are. It was a great highway,
      and dealers with every variety of merchandise resorted to its markets. The
      eyes of the poet dramatist must always have been open for observation. But
      nothing is known positively of Shakespeare from his birth to his marriage
      to Anne Hathaway in 1582, and from that date nothing but the birth of
      three children until we find him an actor in London about 1589.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long acting continued to be Shakespeare's sole profession we have no
      means of knowing, but it is in the highest degree probable that very soon
      after arriving in London he began that work of adaptation by which he is
      known to have begun his literary career. To improve and alter older plays
      not up to the standard that was required at the time was a common practice
      even among the best dramatists of the day, and Shakespeare's abilities
      would speedily mark him out as eminently fitted for this kind of work.
      When the alterations in plays originally composed by other writers became
      very extensive, the work of adaptation would become in reality a work of
      creation. And this is exactly what we have examples of in a few of
      Shakespeare's early works, which are known to have been founded on older
      plays.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary here to extol the published works of the world's
      greatest dramatist. Criticism has been exhausted upon them, and the finest
      minds of England, Germany, and America have devoted their powers to an
      elucidation of their worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare died at Stratford on the 23rd of April, 1616. His father had
      died before him, in 1602, and his mother in 1608. His wife survived him
      till August, 1623. His so Hamnet died in 1596 at the age of eleven years.
      His two daughters survived him, the eldest of whom, Susanna, had, in 1607,
      married a physician of Stratford, Dr. Hall. The only issue of this
      marriage, a daughter named Elizabeth, born in 1608, married first Thomas
      Nasbe, and afterwards Sir John Barnard, but left no children by either
      marriage. Shakespeare's younger daughter, Judith, on the 10th of February,
      1616, married a Stratford gentleman named Thomas Quincy, by whom she had
      three sons, all of whom died, however, without issue. There are thus no
      direct descendants of Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's fellow-actors, fellow-dramatists, and those who knew him in
      other ways, agree in expressing not only admiration of his genius, but
      their respect and love for the man. Ben Jonson said, &ldquo;I love the man, and
      do honor his memory, on this side idolatry, as much as any. He was indeed
      honest, and of an open and free nature.&rdquo; He was buried on the second day
      after his death, on the north side of the chancel of Stratford church.
      Over his grave there is a flat stone with this inscription, said to have
      been written by himself:

    <hr />
    <h2>
      A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> Hermia and Lysander were lovers; but Hermia's father wished her to
      marry another man, named Demetrius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in Athens, where they lived, there was a wicked law, by which any
      girl who refused to marry according to her father's wishes, might be put
      to death. Hermia's father was so angry with her for refusing to do as he
      wished, that he actually brought her before the Duke of Athens to ask that
      she might be killed, if she still refused to obey him. The Duke gave her
      four days to think about it, and, at the end of that time, if she still
      refused to marry Demetrius, she would have to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lysander of course was nearly mad with grief, and the best thing to do
      seemed to him for Hermia to run away to his aunt's house at a place beyond
      the reach of that cruel law; and there he would come to her and marry her.
      But before she started, she told her friend, Helena, what she was going to
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="fairies" id="fairies"></a> <img src="images/dream2.gif"       alt="Please keep photo with html."  /> Helena had been Demetrius' sweetheart
      long before his marriage with Hermia had been thought of, and being very
      silly, like all jealous people, she could not see that it was not poor
      Hermia's fault that Demetrius wished to marry her instead of his own lady,
      Helena. She knew that if she told Demetrius that Hermia was going, as she
      was, to the wood outside Athens, he would follow her, &ldquo;and I can follow
      him, and at least I shall see him,&rdquo; she said to herself. So she went to
      him, and betrayed her friend's secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this wood where Lysander was to meet Hermia, and where the other two
      had decided to follow them, was full of fairies, as most woods are, if one
      only had the eyes to see them, and in this wood on this night were the
      King and Queen of the fairies, Oberon and Titania. Now fairies are very
      wise people, but now and then they can be quite as foolish as mortal folk.
      Oberon and Titania, who might have been as happy as the days were long,
      had thrown away all their joy in a foolish quarrel. They never met without
      saying disagreeable things to each other, and scolded each other so
      dreadfully that all their little fairy followers, for fear, would creep
      into acorn cups and hide them there.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, instead of keeping one happy Court and dancing all night through in
      the moonlight as is fairies' use, the King with his attendants wandered
      through one part of the wood, while the Queen with hers kept state in
      another. And the cause of all this trouble was a little Indian boy whom
      Titania had taken to be one of her followers. Oberon wanted the child to
      follow him and be one of his fairy knights; but the Queen would not give
      him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this night, in a mossy moonlit glade, the King and Queen of the fairies
      met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania,&rdquo; said the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! jealous, Oberon?&rdquo; answered the Queen. &ldquo;You spoil everything with
      your quarreling. Come, fairies, let us leave him. I am not friends with
      him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="quarrel" id="quarrel"></a> <img src="images/dream3.gif"       alt="Please keep photowith html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It rests with you to make up the quarrel,&rdquo; said the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me that little Indian boy, and I will again be your humble servant
      and suitor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set your mind at rest,&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;Your whole fairy kingdom buys
      not that boy from me. Come, fairies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she and her train rode off down the moonbeams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go your ways,&rdquo; said Oberon. &ldquo;But I'll be even with you before you
      leave this wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Oberon called his favorite fairy, Puck. Puck was the spirit of
      mischief. He used to slip into the dairies and take the cream away, and
      get into the churn so that the butter would not come, and turn the beer
      sour, and lead people out of their way on dark nights and then laugh at
      them, and tumble people's stools from under them when they were going to
      sit down, and upset their hot ale over their chins when they were going to
      drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Oberon to this little sprite, &ldquo;fetch me the flower called
      Love-in-idleness. The juice of that little purple flower laid on the eyes
      of those who sleep will make them, when they wake, to love the first thing
      they see. I will put some of the juice of that flower on my Titania's
      eyes, and when she wakes she will love the first thing she sees, were it
      lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, or meddling monkey, or a busy ape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Puck was gone, Demetrius passed through the glade followed by poor
      Helena, and still she told him how she loved him and reminded him of all
      his promises, and still he told her that he did not and could not love
      her, and that his promises were nothing. Oberon was sorry for poor Helena,
      and when Puck returned with the flower, he bade him follow Demetrius and
      put some of the juice on his eyes, so that he might love Helena when he
      woke and looked on her, as much as she loved him. So Puck set off, and
      wandering through the wood found, not Demetrius, but Lysander, on whose
      eyes he put the juice; but when Lysander woke, he saw not his own Hermia,
      but Helena, who was walking through the wood looking for the cruel
      Demetrius; and directly he saw her he loved her and left his own lady,
      under the spell of the purple flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/dream4.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="wood" id="wood"></a> When Hermia woke she found Lysander gone,
      and wandered about the wood trying to find him. Puck went back and told
      Oberon what he had done, and Oberon soon found that he had made a mistake,
      and set about looking for Demetrius, and having found him, put some of the
      juice on his eyes. And the first thing Demetrius saw when he woke was also
      Helena. So now Demetrius and Lysander were both following her through the
      wood, and it was Hermia's turn to follow her lover as Helena had done
      before. The end of it was that Helena and Hermia began to quarrel, and
      Demetrius and Lysander went off to fight. Oberon was very sorry to see his
      kind scheme to help these lovers turn out so badly. So he said to Puck--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These two young men are going to fight. You must overhang the night with
      drooping fog, and lead them so astray, that one will never find the other.
      When they are tired out, they will fall asleep. Then drop this other herb
      on Lysander's eyes. That will give him his old sight and his old love.
      Then each man will have the lady who loves him, and they will all think
      that this has been only a Midsummer Night's Dream. Then when this is done,
      all will be well with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Puck went and did as he was told, and when the two had fallen asleep
      without meeting each other, Puck poured the juice on Lysander's eyes, and
      said:--
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When thou wakest,
      </p>
      <p>
        Thou takest
      </p>
      <p>
        True delight
      </p>
      <p>
        In the sight
      </p>
      <p>
        Of thy former lady's eye:
      </p>
      <p>
        Jack shall have Jill;
      </p>
      <p>
        Nought shall go ill.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <br /> Meanwhile Oberon found Titania asleep on a bank where grew wild
      thyme, oxlips, and violets, and woodbine, musk-roses and eglantine. There
      Titania always slept a part of the night, wrapped in the enameled skin of
      a snake. Oberon stooped over her and laid the juice on her eyes, saying:--
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What thou seest when thou wake,
      </p>
      <p>
        Do it for thy true love take.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <br /> Now, it happened that when Titania woke the first thing she saw was
      a stupid clown, one of a party of players who had come out into the wood
      to rehearse their play. This clown had met with Puck, who had clapped an
      ass's head on his shoulders so that it looked as if it grew there.
      Directly Titania woke and saw this dreadful monster, she said, &ldquo;What angel
      is this? Are you as wise as you are beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am wise enough to find my way out of this wood, that's enough for
      me,&rdquo; said the foolish clown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not desire to go out of the wood,&rdquo; said Titania. The spell of the
      love-juice was on her, and to her the clown seemed the most beautiful and
      delightful creature on all the earth. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Come
      with me, and I will give you fairies to attend on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she called four fairies, whose names were Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth,
      and Mustardseed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must attend this gentleman,&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;Feed him with apricots
      and dewberries, purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries. Steal
      honey-bags for him from the bumble-bees, and with the wings of painted
      butterflies fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said one of the fairies, and all the others said, &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sit down with me,&rdquo; said the Queen to the clown, &ldquo;and let me stroke
      your dear cheeks, and stick musk-roses in your smooth, sleek head, and
      kiss your fair large ears, my gentle joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Peaseblossom?&rdquo; asked the clown with the ass's head. He did not
      care much about the Queen's affection, but he was very proud of having
      fairies to wait on him. &ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; said Peaseblossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scratch my head, Peaseblossom,&rdquo; said the clown. &ldquo;Where's Cobweb?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; said Cobweb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill me,&rdquo; said the clown, &ldquo;the red bumble-bee on the top of the thistle
      yonder, and bring me the honey-bag. Where's Mustardseed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/dream5.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="spell" id="spell"></a> &ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; said Mustardseed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I want nothing,&rdquo; said the clown. &ldquo;Only just help Cobweb to scratch. I
      must go to the barber's, for methinks I am marvelous hairy about the
      face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like anything to eat?&rdquo; said the fairy Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like some good dry oats,&rdquo; said the clown--for his donkey's head
      made him desire donkey's food--&ldquo;and some hay to follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall some of my fairies fetch you new nuts from the squirrel's house?&rdquo;
       asked the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather have a handful or two of good dried peas,&rdquo; said the clown.
      &ldquo;But please don't let any of your people disturb me; I am going to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then said the Queen, &ldquo;And I will wind thee in my arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/dream6.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="awakes" id="awakes"></a> And so when Oberon came along he found
      his beautiful Queen lavishing kisses and endearments on a clown with a
      donkey's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      And before he released her from the enchantment, he persuaded her to give
      him the little Indian boy he so much desired to have. Then he took pity on
      her, and threw some juice of the disenchanting flower on her pretty eyes;
      and then in a moment she saw plainly the donkey-headed clown she had been
      loving, and knew how foolish she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oberon took off the ass's head from the clown, and left him to finish his
      sleep with his own silly head lying on the thyme and violets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus all was made plain and straight again. Oberon and Titania loved each
      other more than ever. Demetrius thought of no one but Helena, and Helena
      had never had any thought of anyone but Demetrius.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Hermia and Lysander, they were as loving a couple as you could meet
      in a day's march, even through a fairy wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the four mortal lovers went back to Athens and were married; and the
      fairy King and Queen live happily together in that very wood at this very
      day.

    <h2>
      THE TEMPEST
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> Prospero, the Duke of Milan, was a learned and studious man, who
      lived among his books, leaving the management of his dukedom to his
      brother Antonio, in whom indeed he had complete trust. But that trust was
      ill-rewarded, for Antonio wanted to wear the duke's crown himself, and, to
      gain his ends, would have killed his brother but for the love the people
      bore him. However, with the help of Prospero's great enemy, Alonso, King
      of Naples, he managed to get into his hands the dukedom with all its
      honor, power, and riches. For they took Prospero to sea, and when they
      were far away from land, forced him into a little boat with no tackle,
      mast, or sail. In their cruelty and hatred they put his little daughter,
      Miranda (not yet three years old), into the boat with him, and sailed
      away, leaving them to their fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one among the courtiers with Antonio was true to his rightful master,
      Prospero. To save the duke from his enemies was impossible, but much could
      be done to remind him of a subject's love. So this worthy lord, whose name
      was Gonzalo, secretly placed in the boat some fresh water, provisions, and
      clothes, and what Prospero valued most of all, some of his precious books.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat was cast on an island, and Prospero and his little one landed in
      safety. Now this island was enchanted, and for years had lain under the
      spell of a fell witch, Sycorax, who had imprisoned in the trunks of trees
      all the good spirits she found there. She died shortly before Prospero was
      cast on those shores, but the spirits, of whom Ariel was the chief, still
      remained in their prisons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prospero was a great magician, for he had devoted himself almost entirely
      to the study of magic during the years in which he allowed his brother to
      manage the affairs of Milan. By his art he set free the imprisoned
      spirits, yet kept them obedient to his will, and they were more truly his
      subjects than his people in Milan had been. For he treated them kindly as
      long as they did his bidding, and he exercised his power over them wisely
      and well. One creature alone he found it necessary to treat with
      harshness: this was Caliban, the son of the wicked old witch, a hideous,
      deformed monster, horrible to look on, and vicious and brutal in all his
      habits.

      When Miranda was grown up into a maiden, sweet and fair to see, it chanced
      that Antonio and Alonso, with Sebastian, his brother, and Ferdinand, his
      son, were at sea together with old Gonzalo, and their ship came near
      Prospero's island. Prospero, knowing they were there, raised by his art a
      great storm, so that even the sailors on board gave themselves up for
      lost; and first among them all Prince Ferdinand leaped into the sea, and,
      as his father thought in his grief, was drowned. But Ariel brought him
      safe ashore; and all the rest of the crew, although they were washed
      overboard, were landed unhurt in different parts of the island, and the
      good ship herself, which they all thought had been wrecked, lay at anchor
      in the harbor whither Ariel had brought her. Such wonders could Prospero
      and his spirits perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/tempest2.gif" alt="Please keep photowith html"  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="sea" id="sea"></a> While yet the tempest was raging, Prospero
      showed his daughter the brave ship laboring in the trough of the sea, and
      told her that it was filled with living human beings like themselves. She,
      in pity of their lives, prayed him who had raised this storm to quell it.
      Then her father bade her to have no fear, for he intended to save every
      one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, for the first time, he told her the story of his life and hers, and
      that he had caused this storm to rise in order that his enemies, Antonio
      and Alonso, who were on board, might be delivered into his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had made an end of his story he charmed her into sleep, for Ariel
      was at hand, and he had work for him to do. Ariel, who longed for his
      complete freedom, grumbled to be kept in drudgery, but on being
      threateningly reminded of all the sufferings he had undergone when Sycorax
      ruled in the land, and of the debt of gratitude he owed to the master who
      had made those sufferings to end, he ceased to complain, and promised
      faithfully to do whatever Prospero might command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so,&rdquo; said Prospero, &ldquo;and in two days I will discharge thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he bade Ariel take the form of a water nymph and sent him in search
      of the young prince. And Ariel, invisible to Ferdinand, hovered near him,
      singing the while--
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come unto these yellow sands
      </p>
      <p>
        And then take hands:
      </p>
      <p>
        Court'sied when you have, and kiss'd
      </p>
      <p>
        (The wild waves whist),
      </p>
      <p>
        Foot it featly here and there;
      </p>
      <p>
        And, sweet sprites, the burden bear!&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And Ferdinand followed the magic singing, as the song changed to a solemn
      air, and the words brought grief to his heart, and tears to his eyes, for
      thus they ran--
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Full fathom five thy father lies;
      </p>
      <p>
        Of his bones are coral made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those are pearls that were his eyes,
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing of him that doth fade,
      </p>
      <p>
        But doth suffer a sea-change
      </p>
      <p>
        Into something rich and strange.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hark! now I hear them,-- ding dong bell!&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And so singing, Ariel led the spell-bound prince into the presence of
      Prospero and Miranda. Then, behold! all happened as Prospero desired. For
      Miranda, who had never, since she could first remember, seen any human
      being save her father, looked on the youthful prince with reverence in her
      eyes, and love in her secret heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might call him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a thing divine, for nothing natural I ever
      saw so noble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Ferdinand, beholding her beauty with wonder and delight, exclaimed--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most sure the goddess on whom these airs attend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nor did he attempt to hide the passion which she inspired in him, for
      scarcely had they exchanged half a dozen sentences, before he vowed to
      make her his queen if she were willing. But Prospero, though secretly
      delighted, pretended wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/tempest3.gif" alt="Please keep photowith html"  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="miranda" id="miranda"></a> &ldquo;You come here as a spy,&rdquo; he said to
      Ferdinand. &ldquo;I will manacle your neck and feet together, and you shall feed
      on fresh water mussels, withered roots and husk, and have sea-water to
      drink. Follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ferdinand, and drew his sword. But on the instant Prospero
      charmed him so that he stood there like a statue, still as stone; and
      Miranda in terror prayed her father to have mercy on her lover. But he
      harshly refused her, and made Ferdinand follow him to his cell. There he
      set the Prince to work, making him remove thousands of heavy logs of
      timber and pile them up; and Ferdinand patiently obeyed, and thought his
      toil all too well repaid by the sympathy of the sweet Miranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      She in very pity would have helped him in his hard work, but he would not
      let her, yet he could not keep from her the secret of his love, and she,
      hearing it, rejoiced and promised to be his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Prospero released him from his servitude, and glad at heart, he gave
      his consent to their marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take her,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she is thine own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Antonio and Sebastian in another part of the island were
      plotting the murder of Alonso, the King of Naples, for Ferdinand being
      dead, as they thought, Sebastian would succeed to the throne on Alonso's
      death. And they would have carried out their wicked purpose while their
      victim was asleep, but that Ariel woke him in good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many tricks did Ariel play them. Once he set a banquet before them, and
      just as they were going to fall to, he appeared to them amid thunder and
      lightning in the form of a harpy, and immediately the banquet disappeared.
      Then Ariel upbraided them with their sins and vanished too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prospero by his enchantments drew them all to the grove without his cell,
      where they waited, trembling and afraid, and now at last bitterly
      repenting them of their sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prospero determined to make one last use of his magic power, &ldquo;And then,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;I'll break my staff and deeper than did ever plummet sound I'll
      drown my book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he made heavenly music to sound in the air, and appeared to them in his
      proper shape as the Duke of Milan. Because they repented, he forgave them
      and told them the story of his life since they had cruelly committed him
      and his baby daughter to the mercy of wind and waves. Alonso, who seemed
      sorriest of them all for his past crimes, lamented the loss of his heir.
      But Prospero drew back a curtain and showed them Ferdinand and Miranda
      playing at chess. Great was Alonso's joy to greet his loved son again, and
      when he heard that the fair maid with whom Ferdinand was playing was
      Prospero's daughter, and that the young folks had plighted their troth, he
      said--
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/tempest4.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="chess" id="chess"></a> &ldquo;Give me your hands, let grief and sorrow
      still embrace his heart that doth not wish you joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So all ended happily. The ship was safe in the harbor, and next day they
      all set sail for Naples, where Ferdinand and Miranda were to be married.
      Ariel gave them calm seas and auspicious gales; and many were the
      rejoicings at the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Prospero, after many years of absence, went back to his own dukedom,
      where he was welcomed with great joy by his faithful subjects. He
      practiced the arts of magic no more, but his life was happy, and not only
      because he had found his own again, but chiefly because, when his
      bitterest foes who had done him deadly wrong lay at his mercy, he took no
      vengeance on them, but nobly forgave them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Ariel, Prospero made him free as air, so that he could wander where
      he would, and sing with a light heart his sweet song--
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /> There was once a wicked Duke named Frederick, who took the dukedom
      that should have belonged to his brother, sending him into exile. His
      brother went into the Forest of Arden, where he lived the life of a bold
      forester, as Robin Hood did in Sherwood Forest in merry England.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/ayli1.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="celia" id="celia"></a> The banished Duke's daughter, Rosalind,
      remained with Celia, Frederick's daughter, and the two loved each other
      more than most sisters. One day there was a wrestling match at Court, and
      Rosalind and Celia went to see it. Charles, a celebrated wrestler, was
      there, who had killed many men in contests of this kind. Orlando, the
      young man he was to wrestle with, was so slender and youthful, that
      Rosalind and Celia thought he would surely be killed, as others had been;
      so they spoke to him, and asked him not to attempt so dangerous an
      adventure; but the only effect of their words was to make him wish more to
      come off well in the encounter, so as to win praise from such sweet
      ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orlando, like Rosalind's father, was being kept out of his inheritance by
      his brother, and was so sad at his brother's unkindness that, until he saw
      Rosalind, he did not care much whether he lived or died. But now the sight
      of the fair Rosalind gave him strength and courage, so that he did
      marvelously, and at last, threw Charles to such a tune, that the wrestler
      had to be carried off the ground. Duke Frederick was pleased with his
      courage, and asked his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Orlando, and I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys,&rdquo;
       said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Sir Rowland de Boys, when he was alive, had been a good friend to the
      banished Duke, so that Frederick heard with regret whose son Orlando was,
      and would not befriend him. But Rosalind was delighted to hear that this
      handsome young stranger was the son of her father's old friend, and as
      they were going away, she turned back more than once to say another kind
      word to the brave young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentleman,&rdquo; she said, giving him a chain from her neck, &ldquo;wear this for
      me. I could give more, but that my hand lacks means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosalind and Celia, when they were alone, began to talk about the handsome
      wrestler, and Rosalind confessed that she loved him at first sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Celia, &ldquo;wrestle with thy affections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; answered Rosalind, &ldquo;they take the part of a better wrestler than
      myself. Look, here comes the Duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With his eyes full of anger,&rdquo; said Celia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must leave the Court at once,&rdquo; he said to Rosalind. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/ayli2.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="chain" id="chain"></a> &ldquo;Never mind why,&rdquo; answered the Duke, &ldquo;you
      are banished. If within ten days you are found within twenty miles of my
      Court, you die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Rosalind set out to seek her father, the banished Duke, in the Forest
      of Arden. Celia loved her too much to let her go alone, and as it was
      rather a dangerous journey, Rosalind, being the taller, dressed up as a
      young countryman, and her cousin as a country girl, and Rosalind said that
      she would be called Ganymede, and Celia, Aliena. They were very tired when
      at last they came to the Forest of Arden, and as they were sitting on the
      grass a countryman passed that way, and Ganymede asked him if he could get
      them food. He did so, and told them that a shepherd's flocks and house
      were to be sold. They bought these and settled down as shepherd and
      shepherdess in the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Oliver having sought to take his brother Orlando's life,
      Orlando also wandered into the forest, and there met with the rightful
      Duke, and being kindly received, stayed with him. Now, Orlando could think
      of nothing but Rosalind, and he went about the forest carving her name on
      trees, and writing love sonnets and hanging them on the bushes, and there
      Rosalind and Celia found them. One day Orlando met them, but he did not
      know Rosalind in her boy's clothes, though he liked the pretty shepherd
      youth, because he fancied a likeness in him to her he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a foolish lover,&rdquo; said Rosalind, &ldquo;who haunts these woods and
      hangs sonnets on the trees. If I could find him, I would soon cure him of
      his folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orlando confessed that he was the foolish lover, and Rosalind said--&ldquo;If
      you will come and see me every day, I will pretend to be Rosalind, and I
      will take her part, and be wayward and contrary, as is the way of women,
      till I make you ashamed of your folly in loving her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so every day he went to her house, and took a pleasure in saying to
      her all the pretty things he would have said to Rosalind; and she had the
      fine and secret joy of knowing that all his love-words came to the right
      ears. Thus many days passed pleasantly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, as Orlando was going to visit Ganymede, he saw a man asleep
      on the ground, and that there was a lioness crouching near, waiting for
      the man who was asleep to wake: for they say that lions will not prey on
      anything that is dead or sleeping. Then Orlando looked at the man, and saw
      that it was his wicked brother, Oliver, who had tried to take his life. He
      fought with the lioness and killed her, and saved his brother's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Orlando was fighting the lioness, Oliver woke to see his brother,
      whom he had treated so badly, saving him from a wild beast at the risk of
      his own life. This made him repent of his wickedness, and he begged
      Orlando's pardon, and from thenceforth they were dear brothers. The
      lioness had wounded Orlando's arm so much, that he could not go on to see
      the shepherd, so he sent his brother to ask Ganymede to come to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver went and told the whole story to Ganymede and Aliena, and Aliena
      was so charmed with his manly way of confessing his faults, that she fell
      in love with him at once. But when Ganymede heard of the danger Orlando
      had been in she fainted; and when she came to herself, said truly enough,
      &ldquo;I should have been a woman by right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver went back to his brother and told him all this, saying, &ldquo;I love
      Aliena so well that I will give up my estates to you and marry her, and
      live here as a shepherd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let your wedding be to-morrow,&rdquo; said Orlando, &ldquo;and I will ask the Duke
      and his friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/ayli3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="faints" id="faints"></a> When Orlando told Ganymede how his
      brother was to be married on the morrow, he added: &ldquo;Oh, how bitter a thing
      it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then answered Rosalind, still in Ganymede's dress and speaking with his
      voic--&ldquo;If you do love Rosalind so near the heart, then when your brother
      marries Aliena, shall you marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the next day the Duke and his followers, and Orlando, and Oliver, and
      Aliena, were all gathered together for the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ganymede came in and said to the Duke, &ldquo;If I bring in your daughter
      Rosalind, will you give her to Orlando here?&rdquo; &ldquo;That I would,&rdquo; said the
      Duke, &ldquo;if I had all kingdoms to give with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you say you will have her when I bring her?&rdquo; she said to Orlando.
      &ldquo;That would I,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;were I king of all kingdoms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Rosalind and Celia went out, and Rosalind put on her pretty woman's
      clothes again, and after a while came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to her father--&ldquo;I give myself to you, for I am yours.&rdquo; &ldquo;If
      there be truth in sight,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are my daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she said to Orlando, &ldquo;I give myself to you, for I am yours.&rdquo; &ldquo;If
      there be truth in sight,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are my Rosalind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will have no father if you be not he,&rdquo; she said to the Duke, and to
      Orlando, &ldquo;I will have no husband if you be not he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Orlando and Rosalind were married, and Oliver and Celia, and they lived
      happy ever after, returning with the Duke to the kingdom. For Frederick
      had been shown by a holy hermit the wickedness of his ways, and so gave
      back the dukedom of his brother, and himself went into a monastery to pray
      for forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding was a merry one, in the mossy glades of the forest. A shepherd
      and shepherdess who had been friends with Rosalind, when she was herself
      disguised as a shepherd, were married on the same day, and all with such
      pretty feastings and merrymakings as could be nowhere within four walls,
      but only in the beautiful green wood.

    </p>
    <p>
      Leontes was the King of Sicily, and his dearest friend was Polixenes, King
      of Bohemia. They had been brought up together, and only separated when
      they reached man's estate and each had to go and rule over his kingdom.
      After many years, when each was married and had a son, Polixenes came to
      stay with Leontes in Sicily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leontes was a violent-tempered man and rather silly, and he took it into
      his stupid head that his wife, Hermione, liked Polixenes better than she
      did him, her own husband. When once he had got this into his head, nothing
      could put it out; and he ordered one of his lords, Camillo, to put a
      poison in Polixenes' wine. Camillo tried to dissuade him from this wicked
      action, but finding he was not to be moved, pretended to consent. He then
      told Polixenes what was proposed against him, and they fled from the Court
      of Sicily that night, and returned to Bohemia, where Camillo lived on as
      Polixenes' friend and counselor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leontes threw the Queen into prison; and her son, the heir to the throne,
      died of sorrow to see his mother so unjustly and cruelly treated.

      its best, and took it to show the King, thinking that the sight of his
      helpless little daughter would soften his heart towards his dear Queen,
      who had never done him any wrong, and who loved him a great deal more than
      he deserved; but the King would not look at the baby, and ordered
      Paulina's husband to take it away in a ship, and leave it in the most
      desert and dreadful place he could find, which Paulina's husband, very
      much against his will, was obliged to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the poor Queen was brought up to be tried for treason in preferring
      Polixenes to her King; but really she had never thought of anyone except
      Leontes, her husband. Leontes had sent some messengers to ask the god,
      Apollo, whether he was not right in his cruel thoughts of the Queen. But
      he had not patience to wait till they came back, and so it happened that
      they arrived in the middle of the trial. The Oracle said--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hermione is innocent, Polixenes blameless, Camillo a true subject,
      Leontes a jealous tyrant, and the King shall live without an heir, if that
      which is lost be not found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a man came and told them that the little Prince was dead. The poor
      Queen, hearing this, fell down in a fit; and then the King saw how wicked
      and wrong he had been. He ordered Paulina and the ladies who were with the
      Queen to take her away, and try to restore her. But Paulina came back in a
      few moments, and told the King that Hermione was dead.
    </p>

      <img src="images/wtale3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="look" id="look"></a> Now Leontes' eyes were at last opened to his
      folly. His Queen was dead, and the little daughter who might have been a
      comfort to him he had sent away to be the prey of wolves and kites. Life
      had nothing left for him now. He gave himself up to his grief, and passed
      many sad years in prayer and remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baby Princess was left on the seacoast of Bohemia, the very kingdom
      where Polixenes reigned. Paulina's husband never went home to tell Leontes
      where he had left the baby; for as he was going back to the ship, he met a
      bear and was torn to pieces. So there was an end of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the poor deserted little baby was found by a shepherd. She was richly
      dressed, and had with her some jewels, and a paper was pinned to her
      cloak, saying that her name was Perdita, and that she came of noble
      parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shepherd, being a kind-hearted man, took home the little baby to his
      wife, and they brought it up as their own child. She had no more teaching
      than a shepherd's child generally has, but she inherited from her royal
      mother many graces and charms, so that she was quite different from the
      other maidens in the village where she lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Prince Florizel, the son of the good King of Bohemia, was bunting
      near the shepherd's house and saw Perdita, now grown up to a charming
      woman. He made friends with the shepherd, not telling him that he was the
      Prince, but saying that his name was Doricles, and that he was a private
      gentleman; and then, being deeply in love with the pretty Perdita, he came
      almost daily to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King could not understand what it was that took his son nearly every
      day from home; so he set people to watch him, and then found out that the
      heir of the King of Bohemia was in love with Perdita, the pretty shepherd
      girl. Polixenes, wishing to see whether this was true, disguised himself,
      and went with the faithful Camillo, in disguise too, to the old shepherd's
      house. They arrived at the feast of sheep-shearing, and, though strangers,
      they were made very welcome. There was dancing going on, and a peddler was
      selling ribbons and laces and gloves, which the young men bought for their
      sweethearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florizel and Perdita, however, were taking no part in this gay scene, but
      sat quietly together talking. The King noticed the charming manners and
      great beauty of Perdita, never guessing that she was the daughter of his
      old friend, Leontes. He said to Camillo--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever ran on the green sward.
      Nothing she does or seems but smacks of something greater than
      herself--too noble for this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Camillo answered, &ldquo;In truth she is the Queen of curds and cream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when Florizel, who did not recognize his father, called upon the
      strangers to witness his betrothal with the pretty shepherdess, the King
      made himself known and forbade the marriage, adding that if ever she saw
      Florizel again, he would kill her and her old father, the shepherd; and
      with that he left them. But Camillo remained behind, for he was charmed
      with Perdita, and wished to befriend her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/wtale4.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="perdita" id="perdita"></a> Camillo had long known how sorry
      Leontes was for that foolish madness of his, and he longed to go back to
      Sicily to see his old master. He now proposed that the young people should
      go there and claim the protection of Leontes. So they went, and the
      shepherd went with them, taking Perdita's jewels, her baby clothes, and
      the paper he had found pinned to her cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leontes received them with great kindness. He was very polite to Prince
      Florizel, but all his looks were for Perdita. He saw how much she was like
      the Queen Hermione, and said again and again--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a sweet creature my daughter might have been, if I had not cruelly
      sent her from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the old shepherd heard that the King had lost a baby daughter, who
      had been left upon the coast of Bohemia, he felt sure that Perdita, the
      child he had reared, must be the King's daughter, and when he told his
      tale and showed the jewels and the paper, the King perceived that Perdita
      was indeed his long-lost child. He welcomed her with joy, and rewarded the
      good shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polixenes had hastened after his son to prevent his marriage with Perdita,
      but when he found that she was the daughter of his old friend, he was only
      too glad to give his consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Leontes could not be happy. He remembered how his fair Queen, who
      should have been at his side to share his joy in his daughter's happiness,
      was dead through his unkindness, and he could say nothing for a long time
      but--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thy mother! thy mother!&rdquo; and ask forgiveness of the King of Bohemia,
      and then kiss his daughter again, and then the Prince Florizel, and then
      thank the old shepherd for all his goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/wtale5.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="talking" id="talking"></a> Then Paulina, who had been high all
      these years in the King's favor, because of her kindness to the dead Queen
      Hermione, said--&ldquo;I have a statue made in the likeness of the dead Queen, a
      piece many years in doing, and performed by the rare Italian master,
      Giulio Romano. I keep it in a private house apart, and there, ever since
      you lost your Queen, I have gone twice or thrice a day. Will it please
      your Majesty to go and see the statue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Leontes and Polixenes, and Florizel and Perdita, with Camillo and their
      attendants, went to Paulina's house where there was a heavy purple curtain
      screening off an alcove; and Paulina, with her hand on the curtain, said--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was peerless when she was alive, and I do believe that her dead
      likeness excels whatever yet you have looked upon, or that the hand of man
      hath done. Therefore I keep it lonely, apart. But here it is--behold, and
      say, 'tis well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that she drew back the curtain and showed them the statue. The
      King gazed and gazed on the beautiful statue of his dead wife, but said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like your silence,&rdquo; said Paulina; &ldquo;it the more shows off your wonder.
      But speak, is it not like her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is almost herself,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;and yet, Paulina, Hermione was not
      so much wrinkled, nothing so old as this seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not by much,&rdquo; said Polixenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Al,&rdquo; said Paulina, &ldquo;that is the cleverness of the carver, who shows her
      to us as she would have been had she lived till now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And still Leontes looked at the statue and could not take his eyes away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had known,&rdquo; said Paulina, &ldquo;that this poor image would so have
      stirred your grief, and love, I would not have shown it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he only answered, &ldquo;Do not draw the curtain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you must not look any longer,&rdquo; said Paulina, &ldquo;or you will think it
      moves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let be! let be!&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;Would you not think it breathed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will draw the curtain,&rdquo; said Paulina; &ldquo;you will think it lives
      presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/wtale6.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="hermione" id="hermione"></a> &ldquo;Ah, sweet Paulina,&rdquo; said Leontes,
      &ldquo;make me to think so twenty years together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can bear it,&rdquo; said Paulina, &ldquo;I can make the statue move, make it
      come down and take you by the hand. Only you would think it was by wicked
      magic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you can make her do, I am content to look on,&rdquo; said the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, all folks there admiring and beholding, the statue moved from
      its pedestal, and came down the steps and put its arms round the King's
      neck, and he held her face and kissed her many times, for this was no
      statue, but the real living Queen Hermione herself. She had lived hidden,
      by Paulina's kindness, all these years, and would not discover herself to
      her husband, though she knew he had repented, because she could not quite
      forgive him till she knew what had become of her little baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Perdita was found, she forgave her husband everything, and it was
      like a new and beautiful marriage to them, to be together once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florizel and Perdita were married and lived long and happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Leontes his many years of suffering were well paid for in the moment
      when, after long grief and pain, he felt the arms of his true love around
      him once again.

    <h2>
      <a name="lear" id="lear">KING LEAR</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      King Lear was old and tired. He was aweary of the business of his kingdom,
      and wished only to end his days quietly near his three daughters. Two of
      his daughters were married to the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall; and the
      Duke of Burgundy and the King of France were both suitors for the hand of
      Cordelia, his youngest daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lear called his three daughters together, and told them that he proposed
      to divide his kingdom between them. &ldquo;But first,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I should like
      to know how much you love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goneril, who was really a very wicked woman, and did not love her father
      at all, said she loved him more than words could say; she loved him dearer
      than eyesight, space or liberty, more than life, grace, health, beauty,
      and honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/klear1.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="france" id="france"></a> &ldquo;I love you as much as my sister and
      more,&rdquo; professed Regan, &ldquo;since I care for nothing but my father's love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lear was very much pleased with Regan's professions, and turned to his
      youngest daughter, Cordelia. &ldquo;Now, our joy, though last not least,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;the best part of my kingdom have I kept for you. What can you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, my lord,&rdquo; answered Cordelia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again,&rdquo; said the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Cordelia answered, &ldquo;I love your Majesty according to my duty--no more,
      no less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this she said, because she was disgusted with the way in which her
      sisters professed love, when really they had not even a right sense of
      duty to their old father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am your daughter,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;and you have brought me up and loved
      me, and I return you those duties back as are right and fit, obey you,
      love you, and most honor you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/klear2.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="regan" id="regan"></a> Lear, who loved Cordelia best, had wished
      her to make more extravagant professions of love than her sisters. &ldquo;Go,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;be for ever a stranger to my heart and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Kent, one of Lear's favorite courtiers and captains, tried to
      say a word for Cordelia's sake, but Lear would not listen. He divided the
      kingdom between Goneril and Regan, and told them that he should only keep
      a hundred knights at arms, and would live with his daughters by turns.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Duke of Burgundy knew that Cordelia would have no share of the
      kingdom, he gave up his courtship of her. But the King of France was
      wiser, and said, &ldquo;Thy dowerless daughter, King, is Queen of us--of ours,
      and our fair France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take her, take her,&rdquo; said the King; &ldquo;for I will never see that face of
      hers again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Cordelia became Queen of France, and the Earl of Kent, for having
      ventured to take her part, was banished from the kingdom. The King now
      went to stay with his daughter Goneril, who had got everything from her
      father that he had to give, and now began to grudge even the hundred
      knights that he had reserved for himself. She was harsh and undutiful to
      him, and her servants either refused to obey his orders or pretended that
      they did not hear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Earl of Kent, when he was banished, made as though he would go
      into another country, but instead he came back in the disguise of a
      servingman and took service with the King. The King had now two
      friends--the Earl of Kent, whom he only knew as his servant, and his Fool,
      who was faithful to him. Goneril told her father plainly that his knights
      only served to fill her Court with riot and feasting; and so she begged
      him only to keep a few old men about him such as himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My train are men who know all parts of duty,&rdquo; said Lear. &ldquo;Goneril, I will
      not trouble you further--yet I have left another daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And his horses being saddled, he set out with his followers for the castle
      of Regan. But she, who had formerly outdone her sister in professions of
      attachment to the King, now seemed to outdo her in undutiful conduct,
      saying that fifty knights were too many to wait on him, and Goneril (who
      had hurried thither to prevent Regan showing any kindness to the old King)
      said five were too many, since her servants could wait on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then when Lear saw that what they really wanted was to drive him away, he
      left them. It was a wild and stormy night, and he wandered about the heath
      half mad with misery, and with no companion but the poor Fool. But
      presently his servant, the good Earl of Kent, met him, and at last
      persuaded him to lie down in a wretched little hovel. At daybreak the Earl
      of Kent removed his royal master to Dover, and hurried to the Court of
      France to tell Cordelia what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cordelia's husband gave her an army and with it she landed at Dover. Here
      she found poor King Lear, wandering about the fields, wearing a crown of
      nettles and weeds. They brought him back and fed and clothed him, and
      Cordelia came to him and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must bear with me,&rdquo; said Lear; &ldquo;forget and forgive. I am old and
      foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/klear3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="prison" id="prison"></a> And now he knew at last which of his
      children it was that had loved him best, and who was worthy of his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goneril and Regan joined their armies to fight Cordelia's army, and were
      successful; and Cordelia and her father were thrown into prison. Then
      Goneril's husband, the Duke of Albany, who was a good man, and had not
      known how wicked his wife was, heard the truth of the whole story; and
      when Goneril found that her husband knew her for the wicked woman she was,
      she killed herself, having a little time before given a deadly poison to
      her sister, Regan, out of a spirit of jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they had arranged that Cordelia should be hanged in prison, and though
      the Duke of Albany sent messengers at once, it was too late. The old King
      came staggering into the tent of the Duke of Albany, carrying the body of
      his dear daughter Cordelia, in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      And soon after, with words of love for her upon his lips, he fell with her
      still in his arms, and died.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="twelfth" id="twelfth">TWELFTH NIGHT</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> Orsino, the Duke of Illyria, was deeply in love with a beautiful
      Countess named Olivia. Yet was all his love in vain, for she disdained his
      suit; and when her brother died, she sent back a messenger from the Duke,
      bidding him tell his master that for seven years she would not let the
      very air behold her face, but that, like a nun, she would walk veiled; and
      all this for the sake of a dead brother's love, which she would keep fresh
      and lasting in her sad remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/tnight1.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="captain" id="captain"></a> The Duke longed for someone to whom he
      could tell his sorrow, and repeat over and over again the story of his
      love. And chance brought him such a companion. For about this time a
      goodly ship was wrecked on the Illyrian coast, and among those who reached
      land in safety were the captain and a fair young maid, named Viola. But
      she was little grateful for being rescued from the perils of the sea,
      since she feared that her twin brother was drowned, Sebastian, as dear to
      her as the heart in her bosom, and so like her that, but for the
      difference in their manner of dress, one could hardly be told from the
      other. The captain, for her comfort, told her that he had seen her brother
      bind himself &ldquo;to a strong mast that lived upon the sea,&rdquo; and that thus
      there was hope that he might be saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viola now asked in whose country she was, and learning that the young Duke
      Orsino ruled there, and was as noble in his nature as in his name, she
      decided to disguise herself in male attire, and seek for employment with
      him as a page.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this she succeeded, and now from day to day she had to listen to the
      story of Orsino's love. At first she sympathized very truly with him, but
      soon her sympathy grew to love. At last it occurred to Orsino that his
      hopeless love-suit might prosper better if he sent this pretty lad to woo
      Olivia for him. Viola unwillingly went on this errand, but when she came
      to the house, Malvolio, Olivia's steward, a vain, officious man, sick, as
      his mistress told him, of self-love, forbade the messenger admittance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viola, however (who was now called Cesario), refused to take any denial,
      and vowed to have speech with the Countess. Olivia, hearing how her
      instructions were defied and curious to see this daring youth, said,
      &ldquo;We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Viola was admitted to her presence and the servants had been sent
      away, she listened patiently to the reproaches which this bold messenger
      from the Duke poured upon her, and listening she fell in love with the
      supposed Cesario; and when Cesario had gone, Olivia longed to send some
      love-token after him. So, calling Malvolio, she bade him follow the boy.

      Malvolio did as he was bid, and then Viola, who of course knew perfectly
      well that she had left no ring behind her, saw with a woman's quickness
      that Olivia loved her. Then she went back to the Duke, very sad at heart
      for her lover, and for Olivia, and for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but cold comfort she could give Orsino, who now sought to ease the
      pangs of despised love by listening to sweet music, while Cesario stood by
      his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Duke to his page that night, &ldquo;you too have been in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little,&rdquo; answered Viola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of woman is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of your complexion,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What years, i' faith?&rdquo; was his next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/tnight3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="love" id="love"></a> To this came the pretty answer, &ldquo;About your
      years, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too old, by Heaven!&rdquo; cried the Duke. &ldquo;Let still the woman take an elder
      than herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Viola very meekly said, &ldquo;I think it well, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By and by Orsino begged Cesario once more to visit Olivia and to plead his
      love-suit. But she, thinking to dissuade him, said--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If some lady loved you as you love Olivia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that cannot be,&rdquo; said the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I know,&rdquo; Viola went on, &ldquo;what love woman may have for a man. My
      father had a daughter loved a man, as it might be,&rdquo; she added blushing,
      &ldquo;perhaps, were I a woman, I should love your lordship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is her history?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A blank, my lord,&rdquo; Viola answered. &ldquo;She never told her love, but let
      concealment like a worm in the bud feed on her damask cheek: she pined in
      thought, and with a green and yellow melancholy she sat, like Patience on
      a monument, smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But died thy sister of her love, my boy?&rdquo; the Duke asked; and Viola, who
      had all the time been telling her own love for him in this pretty fashion,
      said--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all the daughters my father has and all the brothers-- Sir, shall I
      go to the lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To her in haste,&rdquo; said the Duke, at once forgetting all about the story,
      &ldquo;and give her this jewel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Viola went, and this time poor Olivia was unable to hide her love, and
      openly confessed it with such passionate truth, that Viola left her
      hastily, saying--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevermore will I deplore my master's tears to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But in vowing this, Viola did not know the tender pity she would feel for
      other's suffering. So when Olivia, in the violence of her love, sent a
      messenger, praying Cesario to visit her once more, Cesario had no heart to
      refuse the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the favors which Olivia bestowed upon this mere page aroused the
      jealousy of Sir Andrew Aguecheek, a foolish, rejected lover of hers, who
      at that time was staying at her house with her merry old uncle Sir Toby.
      This same Sir Toby dearly loved a practical joke, and knowing Sir Andrew
      to be an arrant coward, he thought that if he could bring off a duel
      between him and Cesario, there would be rare sport indeed. So he induced
      Sir Andrew to send a challenge, which he himself took to Cesario. The poor
      page, in great terror, said--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will return again to the house, I am no fighter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back you shall not to the house,&rdquo; said Sir Toby, &ldquo;unless you fight me
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he looked a very fierce old gentleman, Viola thought it best to
      await Sir Andrew's coming; and when he at last made his appearance, in a
      great fright, if the truth had been known, she tremblingly drew her sword,
      and Sir Andrew in like fear followed her example. Happily for them both,
      at this moment some officers of the Court came on the scene, and stopped
      the intended duel. Viola gladly made off with what speed she might, while
      Sir Toby called after her--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, while these things were happening, Sebastian had escaped all the
      dangers of the deep, and had landed safely in Illyria, where he determined
      to make his way to the Duke's Court. On his way thither he passed Olivia's
      house just as Viola had left it in such a hurry, and whom should he meet
      but Sir Andrew and Sir Toby. Sir Andrew, mistaking Sebastian for the
      cowardly Cesario, took his courage in both hands, and walking up to him
      struck him, saying, &ldquo;There's for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there's for you; and there, and there!&rdquo; said Sebastian, bitting back
      a great deal harder, and again and again, till Sir Toby came to the rescue
      of his friend. Sebastian, however, tore himself free from Sir Toby's
      clutches, and drawing his sword would have fought them both, but that
      Olivia herself, having heard of the quarrel, came running in, and with
      many reproaches sent Sir Toby and his friend away. Then turning to
      Sebastian, whom she too thought to be Cesario, she besought him with many
      a pretty speech to come into the house with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sebastian, half dazed and all delighted with her beauty and grace, readily
      consented, and that very day, so great was Olivia's baste, they were
      married before she had discovered that he was not Cesario, or Sebastian
      was quite certain whether or not he was in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Orsino, hearing how ill Cesario sped with Olivia, visited her
      himself, taking Cesario with him. Olivia met them both before her door,
      and seeing, as she thought, her husband there, reproached him for leaving
      her, while to the Duke she said that his suit was as fat and wholesome to
      her as howling after music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still so cruel?&rdquo; said Orsino.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still so constant,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Orsino's anger growing to cruelty, he vowed that, to be revenged on
      her, he would kill Cesario, whom he knew she loved. &ldquo;Come, boy,&rdquo; he said
      to the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Viola, following him as he moved away, said, &ldquo;I, to do you rest, a
      thousand deaths would die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A great fear took hold on Olivia, and she cried aloud, &ldquo;Cesario, husband,
      stay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her husband?&rdquo; asked the Duke angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord, not I,&rdquo; said Viola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call forth the holy father,&rdquo; cried Olivia.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the priest who had married Sebastian and Olivia, coming in, declared
      Cesario to be the bridegroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O thou dissembling cub!&rdquo; the Duke exclaimed. &ldquo;Farewell, and take her, but
      go where thou and I henceforth may never meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Sir Andrew came up with bleeding crown, complaining that
      Cesario had broken his head, and Sir Toby's as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never hurt you,&rdquo; said Viola, very positively; &ldquo;you drew your sword on
      me, but I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet, for all her protesting, no one there believed her; but all their
      thoughts were on a sudden changed to wonder, when Sebastian came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, madam,&rdquo; he said to his wife, &ldquo;I have hurt your kinsman.
      Pardon me, sweet, even for the vows we made each other so late ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!&rdquo; cried the Duke, looking
      first at Viola, and then at Sebastian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An apple cleft in two,&rdquo; said one who knew Sebastian, &ldquo;is not more twin
      than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never had a brother,&rdquo; said Sebastian. &ldquo;I had a sister, whom the blind
      waves and surges have devoured.&rdquo; &ldquo;Were you a woman,&rdquo; he said to Viola, &ldquo;I
      should let my tears fall upon your cheek, and say, 'Thrice welcome,
      drowned Viola!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Viola, rejoicing to see her dear brother alive, confessed that she
      was indeed his sister, Viola. As she spoke, Orsino felt the pity that is
      akin to love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never shouldst
      love woman like to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all those sayings will I overswear,&rdquo; Viola replied, &ldquo;and all those
      swearings keep true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me thy hand,&rdquo; Orsino cried in gladness. &ldquo;Thou shalt be my wife, and
      my fancy's queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus was the gentle Viola made happy, while Olivia found in Sebastian a
      constant lover, and a good husband, and he in her a true and loving wife.

    <h2>
      <a name="nothing" id="nothing">MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> In Sicily is a town called Messina, which is the scene of a curious
      storm in a teacup that raged several hundred years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began with sunshine. Don Pedro, Prince of Arragon, in Spain, had gained
      so complete a victory over his foes that the very land whence they came is
      forgotten. Feeling happy and playful after the fatigues of war, Don Pedro
      came for a holiday to Messina, and in his suite were his stepbrother Don
      John and two young Italian lords, Benedick and Claudio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benedick was a merry chatterbox, who had determined to live a bachelor.
      Claudio, on the other hand, no sooner arrived at Messina than he fell in
      love with Hero, the daughter of Leonato, Governor of Messina.
    </p>
    <p>
      One July day, a perfumer called Borachio was burning dried lavender in a
      musty room in Leonato's house, when the sound of conversation floated
      through the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/maan1.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="hero" id="hero"></a> &ldquo;Give me your candid opinion of Hero,&rdquo;
       Claudio, asked, and Borachio settled himself for comfortable listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too short and brown for praise,&rdquo; was Benedick's reply; &ldquo;but alter her
      color or height, and you spoil her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my eyes she is the sweetest of women,&rdquo; said Claudio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in mine,&rdquo; retorted Benedick, &ldquo;and I have no need for glasses. She is
      like the last day of December compared with the first of May if you set
      her beside her cousin. Unfortunately, the Lady Beatrice is a fury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice was Leonato's niece. She amused herself by saying witty and
      severe things about Benedick, who called her Dear Lady Disdain. She was
      wont to say that she was born under a dancing star, and could not
      therefore be dull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claudio and Benedick were still talking when Don Pedro came up and said
      good-humoredly, &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, what's the secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am longing,&rdquo; answered Benedick, &ldquo;for your Grace to command me to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I charge you, then, on your allegiance to tell me,&rdquo; said Don Pedro,
      falling in with his humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can be as dumb as a mute,&rdquo; apologized Benedick to Claudio, &ldquo;but his
      Grace commands my speech.&rdquo; To Don Pedro he said, &ldquo;Claudio is in love with
      Hero, Leonato's short daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro was pleased, for he admired Hero and was fond of Claudio. When
      Benedick had departed, he said to Claudio, &ldquo;Be steadfast in your love for
      Hero, and I will help you to win her. To-night her father gives a
      masquerade, and I will pretend I am Claudio, and tell her how Claudio
      loves her, and if she be pleased, I will go to her father and ask his
      consent to your union.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most men like to do their own wooing, but if you fall in love with a
      Governor's only daughter, you are fortunate if you can trust a prince to
      plead for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claudio then was fortunate, but he was unfortunate as well, for he had an
      enemy who was outwardly a friend. This enemy was Don Pedro's stepbrother
      Don John, who was jealous of Claudio because Don Pedro preferred him to
      Don John.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to Don John that Borachio came with the interesting conversation
      which he had overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have some fun at that masquerade myself,&rdquo; said Don John when
      Borachio ceased speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the masquerade, Don Pedro, masked and pretending he was
      Claudio, asked Hero if he might walk with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved away together, and Don John went up to Claudio and said,
      &ldquo;Signor Benedick, I believe?&rdquo; &ldquo;The same,&rdquo; fibbed Claudio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be much obliged then,&rdquo; said Don John, &ldquo;if you would use your
      influence with my brother to cure him of his love for Hero. She is beneath
      him in rank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know he loves her?&rdquo; inquired Claudio.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/maan2.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="ursula" id="ursula"></a> &ldquo;I heard him swear his affection,&rdquo; was
      the reply, and Borachio chimed in with, &ldquo;So did I too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Claudio was then left to himself, and his thought was that his Prince had
      betrayed him. &ldquo;Farewell, Hero,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;I was a fool to trust to an
      agent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Beatrice and Benedick (who was masked) were having a brisk
      exchange of opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Benedick ever make you laugh?&rdquo; asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Benedick?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Prince's jester,&rdquo; replied Beatrice, and she spoke so sharply that &ldquo;I
      would not marry her,&rdquo; he declared afterwards, &ldquo;if her estate were the
      Garden of Eden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the principal speaker at the masquerade was neither Beatrice nor
      Benedick. It was Don Pedro, who carried out his plan to the letter, and
      brought the light back to Claudio's face in a twinkling, by appearing
      before him with Leonato and Hero, and saying, &ldquo;Claudio, when would you
      like to go to church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; was the prompt answer. &ldquo;Time goes on crutches till I marry
      Hero.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give her a week, my dear son,&rdquo; said Leonato, and Claudio's heart thumped
      with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the amiable Don Pedro, &ldquo;we must find a wife for Signor
      Benedick. It is a task for Hercules.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will help you,&rdquo; said Leonato, &ldquo;if I have to sit up ten nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Hero spoke. &ldquo;I will do what I can, my lord, to find a good husband
      for Beatrice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, with happy laughter, ended the masquerade which had given Claudio a
      lesson for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Borachio cheered up Don John by laying a plan before him with which he was
      confident he could persuade both Claudio and Don Pedro that Hero was a
      fickle girl who had two strings to her bow. Don John agreed to this plan
      of hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pedro, on the other hand, had devised a cunning plan of love. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; he
      said to Leonato, &ldquo;we pretend, when Beatrice is near enough to overhear us,
      that Benedick is pining for her love, she will pity him, see his good
      qualities, and love him. And if, when Benedick thinks we don't know he is
      listening, we say how sad it is that the beautiful Beatrice should be in
      love with a heartless scoffer like Benedick, he will certainly be on his
      knees before her in a week or less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So one day, when Benedick was reading in a summer-house, Claudio sat down
      outside it with Leonato, and said, &ldquo;Your daughter told me something about
      a letter she wrote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letter!&rdquo; exclaimed Leonato. &ldquo;She will get up twenty times in the night
      and write goodness knows what. But once Hero peeped, and saw the words
      'Benedick and Beatrice' on the sheet, and then Beatrice tore it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hero told me,&rdquo; said Claudio, &ldquo;that she cried, 'O sweet Benedick!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benedick was touched to the core by this improbable story, which he was
      vain enough to believe. &ldquo;She is fair and good,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I
      must not seem proud. I feel that I love her. People will laugh, of course;
      but their paper bullets will do me no harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Beatrice came to the summerhouse, and said, &ldquo;Against my
      will, I have come to tell you that dinner is ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair Beatrice, I thank you,&rdquo; said Benedick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took no more pains to come than you take pains to thank me,&rdquo; was the
      rejoinder, intended to freeze him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it did not freeze him. It warmed him. The meaning he squeezed out of
      her rude speech was that she was delighted to come to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hero, who had undertaken the task of melting the heart of Beatrice, took
      no trouble to seek an occasion. She simply said to her maid Margaret one
      day, &ldquo;Run into the parlor and whisper to Beatrice that Ursula and I are
      talking about her in the orchard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/maan3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="benedick" id="benedick"></a> Having said this, she felt as sure that
      Beatrice would overhear what was meant for her ears as if she had made an
      appointment with her cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the orchard was a bower, screened from the sun by honeysuckles, and
      Beatrice entered it a few minutes after Margaret had gone on her errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you sure,&rdquo; asked Ursula, who was one of Hero's attendants, &ldquo;that
      Benedick loves Beatrice so devotedly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So say the Prince and my betrothed,&rdquo; replied Hero, &ldquo;and they wished me to
      tell her, but I said, 'No! Let Benedick get over it.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Beatrice is unbearably proud. Her eyes sparkle with disdain and
      scorn. She is too conceited to love. I should not like to see her making
      game of poor Benedick's love. I would rather see Benedick waste away like
      a covered fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't agree with you,&rdquo; said Ursula. &ldquo;I think your cousin is too
      clear-sighted not to see the merits of Benedick.&rdquo; &ldquo;He is the one man in
      Italy, except Claudio,&rdquo; said Hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talkers then left the orchard, and Beatrice, excited and tender,
      stepped out of the summer-house, saying to herself, &ldquo;Poor dear Benedick,
      be true to me, and your love shall tame this wild heart of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We now return to the plan of hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night before the day fixed for Claudio's wedding, Don John entered a
      room in which Don Pedro and Claudio were conversing, and asked Claudio if
      he intended to be married to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know he does!&rdquo; said Don Pedro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may know differently,&rdquo; said Don John, &ldquo;when he has seen what I will
      show him if he will follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They followed him into the garden; and they saw a lady leaning out of
      Hero's window talking love to Borachio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claudio thought the lady was Hero, and said, &ldquo;I will shame her for it
      to-morrow!&rdquo; Don Pedro thought she was Hero, too; but she was not Hero; she
      was Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don John chuckled noiselessly when Claudio and Don Pedro quitted the
      garden; he gave Borachio a purse containing a thousand ducats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The money made Borachio feel very gay, and when he was walking in the
      street with his friend Conrade, he boasted of his wealth and the giver,
      and told what he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      A watchman overheard them, and thought that a man who had been paid a
      thousand ducats for villainy was worth taking in charge. He therefore
      arrested Borachio and Conrade, who spent the rest of the night in prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before noon of the next day half the aristocrats in Messina were at
      church. Hero thought it was her wedding day, and she was there in her
      wedding dress, no cloud on her pretty face or in her frank and shining
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest was Friar Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to Claudio, he said, &ldquo;You come hither, my lord, to marry this
      lady?&rdquo; &ldquo;No!&rdquo; contradicted Claudio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonato thought he was quibbling over grammar. &ldquo;You should have said,
      Friar,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;'You come to be married to her.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Friar Francis turned to Hero. &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you come hither to be
      married to this Count?&rdquo; &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If either of you know any impediment to this marriage, I charge you to
      utter it,&rdquo; said the Friar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know of any, Hero?&rdquo; asked Claudio. &ldquo;None,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know you of any, Count?&rdquo; demanded the Friar. &ldquo;I dare reply for him,
      'None,'&rdquo; said Leonato.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claudio exclaimed bitterly, &ldquo;O! what will not men dare say! Father,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;will you give me your daughter?&rdquo; &ldquo;As freely,&rdquo; replied Leonato,
      &ldquo;as God gave her to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what can I give you,&rdquo; asked Claudio, &ldquo;which is worthy of this gift?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Don Pedro, &ldquo;unless you give the gift back to the giver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet Prince, you teach me,&rdquo; said Claudio. &ldquo;There, Leonato, take her
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These brutal words were followed by others which flew from Claudio, Don
      Pedro and Don John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church seemed no longer sacred. Hero took her own part as long as she
      could, then she swooned. All her persecutors left the church, except her
      father, who was befooled by the accusations against her, and cried, &ldquo;Hence
      from her! Let her die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Friar Francis saw Hero blameless with his clear eyes that probed the
      soul. &ldquo;She is innocent,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;a thousand signs have told me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hero revived under his kind gaze. Her father, flurried and angry, knew not
      what to think, and the Friar said, &ldquo;They have left her as one dead with
      shame. Let us pretend that she is dead until the truth is declared, and
      slander turns to remorse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Friar advises well,&rdquo; said Benedick. Then Hero was led away into a
      retreat, and Beatrice and Benedick remained alone in the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benedick knew she had been weeping bitterly and long. &ldquo;Surely I do believe
      your fair cousin is wronged,&rdquo; he said. She still wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not strange,&rdquo; asked Benedick, gently, &ldquo;that I love nothing in the
      world as well as you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were as possible for me to say I loved nothing as well as you,&rdquo; said
      Beatrice, &ldquo;but I do not say it. I am sorry for my cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what to do for her,&rdquo; said Benedick. &ldquo;Kill Claudio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! not for the wide world,&rdquo; said Benedick. &ldquo;Your refusal kills me,&rdquo; said
      Beatrice. &ldquo;Farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! I will challenge him,&rdquo; cried Benedick.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this scene Borachio and Conrade were in prison. There they were
      examined by a constable called Dogberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchman gave evidence to the effect that Borachio had said that he
      had received a thousand ducats for conspiring against Hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonato was not present at this examination, but he was nevertheless now
      thoroughly convinced Of Hero's innocence. He played the part of bereaved
      father very well, and when Don Pedro and Claudio called on him in a
      friendly way, he said to the Italian, &ldquo;You have slandered my child to
      death, and I challenge you to combat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot fight an old man,&rdquo; said Claudio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could kill a girl,&rdquo; sneered Leonato, and Claudio crimsoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hot words grew from hot words, and both Don Pedro and Claudio were feeling
      scorched when Leonato left the room and Benedick entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man,&rdquo; said Claudio, &ldquo;was like to have snapped my nose off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a villain!&rdquo; said Benedick, shortly. &ldquo;Fight me when and with what
      weapon you please, or I call you a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Claudio was astounded, but said, &ldquo;I'll meet you. Nobody shall say I can't
      carve a calf's head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benedick smiled, and as it was time for Don Pedro to receive officials,
      the Prince sat down in a chair of state and prepared his mind for justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door soon opened to admit Dogberry and his prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What offence,&rdquo; said Don Pedro, &ldquo;are these men charged with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/maan4.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="francis" id="francis"></a> Borachio thought the moment a happy
      one for making a clean breast of it. He laid the whole blame on Don John,
      who had disappeared. &ldquo;The lady Hero being dead,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I desire
      nothing but the reward of a murderer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Claudio heard with anguish and deep repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the re-entrance of Leonato be said to him, &ldquo;This slave makes clear
      your daughter's innocence. Choose your revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leonato,&rdquo; said Don Pedro, humbly, &ldquo;I am ready for any penance you may
      impose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you both, then,&rdquo; said Leonato, &ldquo;to proclaim my daughter's
      innocence, and to honor her tomb by singing her praise before it. As for
      you, Claudio, I have this to say: my brother has a daughter so like Hero
      that she might be a copy of her. Marry her, and my vengeful feelings die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noble sir,&rdquo; said Claudio, &ldquo;I am yours.&rdquo; Claudio then went to his room and
      composed a solemn song. Going to the church with Don Pedro and his
      attendants, he sang it before the monument of Leonato's family. When he
      had ended he said, &ldquo;Good night, Hero. Yearly will I do this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then gravely, as became a gentleman whose heart was Hero's, made ready
      to marry a girl whom he did not love. He was told to meet her in Leonato's
      house, and was faithful to his appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was shown into a room where Antonio (Leonato's brother) and several
      masked ladies entered after him. Friar Francis, Leonato, and Benedick were
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonio led one of the ladies towards Claudio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;let me see your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swear first to marry her,&rdquo; said Leonato.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your hand,&rdquo; said Claudio to the lady; &ldquo;before this holy friar I
      swear to marry you if you will be my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alive I was your wife,&rdquo; said the lady, as she drew off her mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another Hero!&rdquo; exclaimed Claudio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hero died,&rdquo; explained Leonato, &ldquo;only while slander lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Friar was then going to marry the reconciled pair, but Benedick
      interrupted him with, &ldquo;Softly, Friar; which of these ladies is Beatrice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hereat Beatrice unmasked, and Benedick said, &ldquo;You love me, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only moderately,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moderately,&rdquo; answered Benedick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told you were well-nigh dead for me,&rdquo; remarked Beatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of you I was told the same,&rdquo; said Benedick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's your own hand in evidence of your love,&rdquo; said Claudio, producing a
      feeble sonnet which Benedick had written to his sweetheart. &ldquo;And here,&rdquo;
       said Hero, &ldquo;is a tribute to Benedick, which I picked out of the pocket of
      Beatrice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A miracle!&rdquo; exclaimed Benedick. &ldquo;Our hands are against our hearts! Come,
      I will marry you, Beatrice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall be my husband to save your life,&rdquo; was the rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benedick kissed her on the mouth; and the Friar married them after he had
      married Claudio and Hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Benedick the married man?&rdquo; asked Don Pedro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too happy to be made unhappy,&rdquo; replied Benedick. &ldquo;Crack what jokes you
      will. As for you, Claudio, I had hoped to run you through the body, but as
      you are now my kinsman, live whole and love my cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cudgel was in love with you, Benedick, until to-day,&rdquo; said Claudio;
      but, &ldquo;Come, come, let's dance,&rdquo; said Benedick.
    </p>
    <p>
      And dance they did. Not even the news of the capture of Don John was able
      to stop the flying feet of the happy lovers, for revenge is not sweet
      against an evil man who has failed to do harm.

    <h2>
      <a name="rj" id="rj">ROMEO AND JULIET</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once upon a time there lived in Verona two great families named Montagu
      and Capulet. They were both rich, and I suppose they were as sensible, in
      most things, as other rich people. But in one thing they were extremely
      silly. There was an old, old quarrel between the two families, and instead
      of making it up like reasonable folks, they made a sort of pet of their
      quarrel, and would not let it die out. So that a Montagu wouldn't speak to
      a Capulet if he met one in the street--nor a Capulet to a Montagu--or if
      they did speak, it was to say rude and unpleasant things, which often
      ended in a fight. And their relations and servants were just as foolish,
      so that street fights and duels and uncomfortablenesses of that kind were
      always growing out of the Montagu-and-Capulet quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Lord Capulet, the head of that family, gave a party-- a grand supper
      and a dance--and he was so hospitable that he said anyone might come to it
      except (of course) the Montagues. But there was a young Montagu named
      Romeo, who very much wanted to be there, because Rosaline, the lady he
      loved, had been asked. This lady had never been at all kind to him, and he
      had no reason to love her; but the fact was that he wanted to love
      somebody, and as he hadn't seen the right lady, he was obliged to love the
      wrong one. So to the Capulet's grand party he came, with his friends
      Mercutio and Benvolio.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/rj1.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="fight" id="fight"></a> Old Capulet welcomed him and his two
      friends very kindly--and young Romeo moved about among the crowd of
      courtly folk dressed in their velvets and satins, the men with jeweled
      sword hilts and collars, and the ladies with brilliant gems on breast and
      arms, and stones of price set in their bright girdles. Romeo was in his
      best too, and though he wore a black mask over his eyes and nose, everyone
      could see by his mouth and his hair, and the way he held his head, that he
      was twelve times handsomer than anyone else in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently amid the dancers he saw a lady so beautiful and so lovable that
      from that moment he never again gave one thought to that Rosaline whom he
      had thought he loved. And he looked at this other fair lady, as she moved
      in the dance in her white satin and pearls, and all the world seemed vain
      and worthless to him compared with her. And he was saying this, or
      something like it, when Tybalt, Lady Capulet's nephew, hearing his voice,
      knew him to be Romeo. Tybalt, being very angry, went at once to his uncle,
      and told him how a Montagu had come uninvited to the feast; but old
      Capulet was too fine a gentleman to be discourteous to any man under his
      own roof, and he bade Tybalt be quiet. But this young man only waited for
      a chance to quarrel with Romeo.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Romeo made his way to the fair lady, and told her in sweet
      words that he loved her, and kissed her. Just then her mother sent for
      her, and then Romeo found out that the lady on whom he had set his heart's
      hopes was Juliet, the daughter of Lord Capulet, his sworn foe. So he went
      away, sorrowing indeed, but loving her none the less.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/rj3.gif" alt="Please keep photowith html"  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="juliet" id="juliet"></a> Then Juliet said to her nurse:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that gentleman that would not dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is Romeo, and a Montagu, the only son of your great enemy,&rdquo;
       answered the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Juliet went to her room, and looked out of her window, over the
      beautiful green-grey garden, where the moon was shining. And Romeo was
      hidden in that garden among the trees--because he could not bear to go
      right away without trying to see her again. So she--not knowing him to be
      there--spoke her secret thought aloud, and told the quiet garden how she
      loved Romeo.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Romeo heard and was glad beyond measure. Hidden below, he looked up
      and saw her fair face in the moonlight, framed in the blossoming creepers
      that grew round her window, and as he looked and listened, he felt as
      though he had been carried away in a dream, and set down by some magician
      in that beautiful and enchanted garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah--why are you called Romeo?&rdquo; said Juliet. &ldquo;Since I love you, what does
      it matter what you are called?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized--henceforth I never will be
      Romeo,&rdquo; he cried, stepping into the full white moonlight from the shade of
      the cypresses and oleanders that had hidden him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was frightened at first, but when she saw that it was Romeo himself,
      and no stranger, she too was glad, and, he standing in the garden below
      and she leaning from the window, they spoke long together, each one trying
      to find the sweetest words in the world, to make that pleasant talk that
      lovers use. And the tale of all they said, and the sweet music their
      voices made together, is all set down in a golden book, where you children
      may read it for yourselves some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the time passed so quickly, as it does for folk who love each other
      and are together, that when the time came to part, it seemed as though
      they had met but that moment-- and indeed they hardly knew how to part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send to you to-morrow,&rdquo; said Juliet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so at last, with lingering and longing, they said good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juliet went into her room, and a dark curtain bid her bright window. Romeo
      went away through the still and dewy garden like a man in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, very early, Romeo went to Friar Laurence, a priest, and,
      telling him all the story, begged him to marry him to Juliet without
      delay. And this, after some talk, the priest consented to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when Juliet sent her old nurse to Romeo that day to know what he
      purposed to do, the old woman took back a message that all was well, and
      all things ready for the marriage of Juliet and Romeo on the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/rj4.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="juliet2" id="juliet2"></a> The young lovers were afraid to ask
      their parents' consent to their marriage, as young people should do,
      because of this foolish old quarrel between the Capulets and the
      Montagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Friar Laurence was willing to help the young lovers secretly, because
      he thought that when they were once married their parents might soon be
      told, and that the match might put a happy end to the old quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the next morning early, Romeo and Juliet were married at Friar
      Laurence's cell, and parted with tears and kisses. And Romeo promised to
      come into the garden that evening, and the nurse got ready a rope-ladder
      to let down from the window, so that Romeo could climb up and talk to his
      dear wife quietly and alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that very day a dreadful thing happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tybalt, the young man who had been so vexed at Romeo's going to the
      Capulet's feast, met him and his two friends, Mercutio and Benvolio, in
      the street, called Romeo a villain, and asked him to fight. Romeo had no
      wish to fight with Juliet's cousin, but Mercutio drew his sword, and he
      and Tybalt fought. And Mercutio was killed. When Romeo saw that this
      friend was dead, he forgot everything except anger at the man who had
      killed him, and he and Tybalt fought till Tybalt fell dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, on the very day of his wedding, Romeo killed his dear Juliet's cousin,
      and was sentenced to be banished. Poor Juliet and her young husband met
      that night indeed; he climbed the rope-ladder among the flowers, and found
      her window, but their meeting was a sad one, and they parted with bitter
      tears and hearts heavy, because they could not know when they should meet
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Juliet's father, who, of course, had no idea that she was married,
      wished her to wed a gentleman named Paris, and was so angry when she
      refused, that she hurried away to ask Friar Laurence what she should do.
      He advised her to pretend to consent, and then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you a draught that will make you seem to be dead for two
      days, and then when they take you to church it will be to bury you, and
      not to marry you. They will put you in the vault thinking you are dead,
      and before you wake up Romeo and I will be there to take care of you. Will
      you do this, or are you afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do it; talk not to me of fear!&rdquo; said Juliet. And she went home and
      told her father she would marry Paris. If she had spoken out and told her
      father the truth . . . well, then this would have been a different story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Capulet was very much pleased to get his own way, and set about
      inviting his friends and getting the wedding feast ready. Everyone stayed
      up all night, for there was a great deal to do, and very little time to do
      it in. Lord Capulet was anxious to get Juliet married because he saw she
      was very unhappy. Of course she was really fretting about her husband
      Romeo, but her father thought she was grieving for the death of her cousin
      Tybalt, and he thought marriage would give her something else to think
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning the nurse came to call Juliet, and to dress her for
      her wedding; but she would not wake, and at last the nurse cried out
      suddenly--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! alas! help! help! my lady's dead! Oh, well-a-day that ever I was
      born!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Capulet came running in, and then Lord Capulet, and Lord Paris, the
      bridegroom. There lay Juliet cold and white and lifeless, and all their
      weeping could not wake her. So it was a burying that day instead of a
      marrying. Meantime Friar Laurence had sent a messenger to Mantua with a
      letter to Romeo telling him of all these things; and all would have been
      well, only the messenger was delayed, and could not go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/rj5.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="dead" id="dead"></a> But ill news travels fast. Romeo's servant
      who knew the secret of the marriage, but not of Juliet's pretended death,
      heard of her funeral, and hurried to Mantua to tell Romeo how his young
      wife was dead and lying in the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; cried Romeo, heart-broken. &ldquo;Then I will lie by Juliet's side
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he bought himself a poison, and went straight back to Verona. He
      hastened to the tomb where Juliet was lying. It was not a grave, but a
      vault. He broke open the door, and was just going down the stone steps
      that led to the vault where all the dead Capulets lay, when he heard a
      voice behind him calling on him to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the Count Paris, who was to have married Juliet that very day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you come here and disturb the dead bodies of the Capulets, you
      vile Montagu?&rdquo; cried Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Romeo, half mad with sorrow, yet tried to answer gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were told,&rdquo; said Paris, &ldquo;that if you returned to Verona you must
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must indeed,&rdquo; said Romeo. &ldquo;I came here for nothing else. Good, gentle
      youth--leave me! Oh, go--before I do you any harm! I love you better than
      myself--go--leave me here--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/rj6.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="tomb" id="tomb"></a> Then Paris said, &ldquo;I defy you, and I arrest
      you as a felon,&rdquo; and Romeo, in his anger and despair, drew his sword. They
      fought, and Paris was killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Romeo's sword pierced him, Paris cried--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am slain! If thou be merciful, open the tomb, and lay me with
      Juliet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Romeo said, &ldquo;In faith I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he carried the dead man into the tomb and laid him by the dear
      Juliet's side. Then he kneeled by Juliet and spoke to her, and held her in
      his arms, and kissed her cold lips, believing that she was dead, while all
      the while she was coming nearer and nearer to the time of her awakening.
      Then he drank the poison, and died beside his sweetheart and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now came Friar Laurence when it was too late, and saw all that had
      happened--and then poor Juliet woke out of her sleep to find her husband
      and her friend both dead beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of the fight had brought other folks to the place too, and Friar
      Laurence, hearing them, ran away, and Juliet was left alone. She saw the
      cup that had held the poison, and knew how all had happened, and since no
      poison was left for her, she drew her Romeo's dagger and thrust it through
      her heart--and so, falling with her head on her Romeo's breast, she died.
      And here ends the story of these faithful and most unhappy lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * * * * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the old folks knew from Friar Laurence of all that had befallen,
      they sorrowed exceedingly, and now, seeing all the mischief their wicked
      quarrel had wrought, they repented them of it, and over the bodies of
      their dead children they clasped hands at last, in friendship and
      forgiveness.

    <hr />
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="perciles" id="perciles">PERICLES</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> Pericles, the Prince of Tyre, was unfortunate enough to make an
      enemy of Antiochus, the powerful and wicked King of Antioch; and so great
      was the danger in which he stood that, on the advice of his trusty
      counselor, Lord Helicanus, he determined to travel about the world for a
      time. He came to this decision despite the fact that, by the death of his
      father, he was now King of Tyre. So he set sail for Tarsus, appointing
      Helicanus Regent during his absence. That he did wisely in thus leaving
      his kingdom was soon made clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had he sailed on his voyage, when Lord Thaliard arrived from
      Antioch with instructions from his royal master to kill Pericles. The
      faithful Helicanus soon discovered the deadly purpose of this wicked lord,
      and at once sent messengers to Tarsus to warn the King of the danger which
      threatened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people of Tarsus were in such poverty and distress that Pericles,
      feeling that he could find no safe refuge there, put to sea again. But a
      dreadful storm overtook the ship in which he was, and the good vessel was
      wrecked, while of all on board only Pericles was saved. Bruised and wet
      and faint, he was flung upon the cruel rocks on the coast of Pentapolis,
      the country of the good King Simonides. Worn out as he was, he looked for
      nothing but death, and that speedily. But some fishermen, coming down to
      the beach, found him there, and gave him clothes and bade him be of good
      cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou shalt come home with me,&rdquo; said one of them, &ldquo;and we will have flesh
      for holidays, fish for fasting days, and moreo'er, puddings and flapjacks,
      and thou shalt be welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They told him that on the morrow many princes and knights were going to
      the King's Court, there to joust and tourney for the love of his daughter,
      the beautiful Princess Thaisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did but my fortunes equal my desires,&rdquo; said Pericles, &ldquo;I'd wish to make
      one there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, some of the fishermen came by, drawing their net, and it
      dragged heavily, resisting all their efforts, but at last they hauled it
      in, to find that it contained a suit of rusty armor; and looking at it, he
      blessed Fortune for her kindness, for he saw that it was his own, which
      had been given to him by his dead father. He begged the fishermen to let
      him have it that he might go to Court and take part in the tournament,
      promising that if ever his ill fortunes bettered, he would reward them
      well. The fishermen readily consented, and being thus fully equipped,
      Pericles set off in his rusty armor to the King's Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tournament none bore himself so well as Pericles, and he won the
      wreath of victory, which the fair Princess herself placed on his brows.
      Then at her father's command she asked him who he was, and whence he came;
      and he answered that he was a knight of Tyre, by name Pericles, but he did
      not tell her that he was the King of that country, for he knew that if
      once his whereabouts became known to Antiochus, his life would not be
      worth a pin's purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless Thaisa loved him dearly, and the King was so pleased with his
      courage and graceful bearing that he gladly permitted his daughter to have
      her own way, when she told him she would marry the stranger knight or die.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/perci1.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="tournament" id="tournament"></a> Thus Pericles became the husband
      of the fair lady for whose sake he had striven with the knights who came
      in all their bravery to joust and tourney for her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the wicked King Antiochus had died, and the people in Tyre,
      hearing no news of their King, urged Lord Helicanus to ascend the vacant
      throne. But they could only get him to promise that he would become their
      King, if at the end of a year Pericles did not come back. Moreover, he
      sent forth messengers far and wide in search of the missing Pericles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these made their way to Pentapolis, and finding their King there,
      told him how discontented his people were at his long absence, and that,
      Antiochus being dead, there was nothing now to hinder him from returning
      to his kingdom. Then Pericles told his wife and father-in-law who he
      really was, and they and all the subjects of Simonides greatly rejoiced to
      know that the gallant husband of Thaisa was a King in his own right. So
      Pericles set sail with his dear wife for his native land. But once more
      the sea was cruel to him, for again a dreadful storm broke out, and while
      it was at its height, a servant came to tell him that a little daughter
      was born to him. This news would have made his heart glad indeed, but that
      the servant went on to add that his wife--his dear, dear Thaisa--was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was praying the gods to be good to his little baby girl, the
      sailors came to him, declaring that the dead Queen must be thrown
      overboard, for they believed that the storm would never cease so long as a
      dead body remained in the vessel. So Thaisa was laid in a big chest with
      spices and jewels, and a scroll on which the sorrowful King wrote these
      lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I give to understand
    </p>
    <p>
      (If e'er this coffin drive a-land),
    </p>
    <p>
      I, King Pericles, have lost
    </p>
    <p>
      This Queen worth all our mundane cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who finds her, give her burying;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the daughter of a King;
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides this treasure for a fee,
    </p>
    <p>
      The gods requite his charity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> Then the chest was cast into the sea, and the waves taking it, by
      and by washed it ashore at Ephesus, where it was found by the servants of
      a lord named Cerimon. He at once ordered it to be opened, and when he saw
      how lovely Thaisa looked, he doubted if she were dead, and took immediate
      steps to restore her. Then a great wonder happened, for she, who had been
      thrown into the sea as dead, came back to life. But feeling sure that she
      would never see her husband again, Thaisa retired from the world, and
      became a priestess of the Goddess Diana.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these things were happening, Pericles went on to Tarsus with his
      little daughter, whom he called Marina, because she had been born at sea.
      Leaving her in the hands of his old friend the Governor of Tarsus, the
      King sailed for his own dominions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Dionyza, the wife of the Governor of Tarsus, was a jealous and wicked
      woman, and finding that the young Princess grew up a more accomplished and
      charming girl than her own daughter, she determined to take Marina's life.
      So when Marina was fourteen, Dionyza ordered one of her servants to take
      her away and kill her. This villain would have done so, but that he was
      interrupted by some pirates who came in and carried Marina off to sea with
      them, and took her to Mitylene, where they sold her as a slave. Yet such
      was her goodness, her grace, and her beauty, that she soon became honored
      there, and Lysimachus, the young Governor, fell deep in love with her, and
      would have married her, but that he thought she must be of too humble
      parentage to become the wife of one in his high position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wicked Dionyza believed, from her servant's report, that Marina was
      really dead, and so she put up a monument to her memory, and showed it to
      King Pericles, when after long years of absence he came to see his
      much-loved child. When he heard that she was dead, his grief was terrible
      to see. He set sail once more, and putting on sackcloth, vowed never to
      wash his face or cut his hair again. There was a pavilion erected on deck,
      and there he lay alone, and for three months he spoke word to none.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last it chanced that his ship came into the port of Mitylene, and
      Lysimachus, the Governor, went on board to enquire whence the vessel came.
      When he heard the story of Pericles' sorrow and silence, he bethought him
      of Marina, and believing that she could rouse the King from his stupor,
      sent for her and bade her try her utmost to persuade the King to speak,
      promising whatever reward she would, if she succeeded. Marina gladly
      obeyed, and sending the rest away, she sat and sang to her poor
      grief-laden father, yet, sweet as was her voice, he made no sign. So
      presently she spoke to him, saying that her grief might equal his, for,
      though she was a slave, she came from ancestors that stood equal to mighty
      kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in her voice and story touched the King's heart, and he looked
      up at her, and as he looked, he saw with wonder how like she was to his
      lost wife, so with a great hope springing up in his heart, he bade her
      tell her story.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/perci2.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="marina" id="marina"></a> Then, with many interruptions from the
      King, she told him who she was and how she had escaped from the cruel
      Dionyza. So Pericles knew that this was indeed his daughter, and he kissed
      her again and again, crying that his great seas of joy drowned him with
      their sweetness. &ldquo;Give me my robes,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;O Heaven, bless my girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there came to him, though none else could hear it, the sound of
      heavenly music, and falling asleep, he beheld the goddess Diana, in a
      vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; she said to him, &ldquo;to my temple at Ephesus, and when my maiden
      priests are met together, reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pericles obeyed the goddess and told his tale before her altar. Hardly had
      he made an end, when the chief priestess, crying out, &ldquo;You are--you are--O
      royal Pericles!&rdquo; fell fainting to the ground, and presently recovering,
      she spoke again to him, &ldquo;O my lord, are you not Pericles?&rdquo; &ldquo;The voice of
      dead Thaisa!&rdquo; exclaimed the King in wonder. &ldquo;That Thaisa am I,&rdquo; she said,
      and looking at her he saw that she spoke the very truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Pericles and Thaisa, after long and bitter suffering, found happiness
      once more, and in the joy of their meeting they forgot the pain of the
      past. To Marina great happiness was given, and not only in being restored
      to her dear parents; for she married Lysimachus, and became a princess in
      the land where she had been sold as a slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="hamlet" id="hamlet">HAMLET</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> Hamlet was the only son of the King of Denmark. He loved his father
      and mother dearly--and was happy in the love of a sweet lady named
      Ophelia. Her father, Polonius, was the King's Chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Hamlet was away studying at Wittenberg, his father died. Young
      Hamlet hastened home in great grief to hear that a serpent had stung the
      King, and that he was dead. The young Prince had loved his father so
      tenderly that you may judge what he felt when he found that the Queen,
      before yet the King had been laid in the ground a month, had determined to
      marry again--and to marry the dead King's brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamlet refused to put off mourning for the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not only the black I wear on my body,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that proves my
      loss. I wear mourning in my heart for my dead father. His son at least
      remembers him, and grieves still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then said Claudius the King's brother, &ldquo;This grief is unreasonable. Of
      course you must sorrow at the loss of your father, but--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Hamlet, bitterly, &ldquo;I cannot in one little month forget those I
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that the Queen and Claudius left him, to make merry over their
      wedding, forgetting the poor good King who had been so kind to them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Hamlet, left alone, began to wonder and to question as to what he
      ought to do. For he could not believe the story about the snake-bite. It
      seemed to him all too plain that the wicked Claudius had killed the King,
      so as to get the crown and marry the Queen. Yet he had no proof, and could
      not accuse Claudius.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while he was thus thinking came Horatio, a fellow student of his, from
      Wittenberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brought you here?&rdquo; asked Hamlet, when he had greeted his friend
      kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came, my lord, to see your father's funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it was to see my mother's wedding,&rdquo; said Hamlet, bitterly. &ldquo;My
      father! We shall not look upon his like again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; answered Horatio, &ldquo;I think I saw him yesternight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/hamlet1.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="appears" id="appears"></a> Then, while Hamlet listened in surprise,
      Horatio told how he, with two gentlemen of the guard, had seen the King's
      ghost on the battlements. Hamlet went that night, and true enough, at
      midnight, the ghost of the King, in the armor he had been wont to wear,
      appeared on the battlements in the chill moonlight. Hamlet was a brave
      youth. Instead of running away from the ghost he spoke to it--and when it
      beckoned him he followed it to a quiet place, and there the ghost told him
      that what he had suspected was true. The wicked Claudius had indeed killed
      his good brother the King, by dropping poison into his ear as he slept in
      his orchard in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; said the ghost, &ldquo;must avenge this cruel murder-- on my wicked
      brother. But do nothing against the Queen-- for I have loved her, and she
      is your mother. Remember me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then seeing the morning approach, the ghost vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Hamlet, &ldquo;there is nothing left but revenge. Remember thee--I
      will remember nothing else--books, pleasure, youth--let all go--and your
      commands alone live on my brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So when his friends came back he made them swear to keep the secret of the
      ghost, and then went in from the battlements, now gray with mingled dawn
      and moonlight, to think how he might best avenge his murdered father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock of seeing and hearing his father's ghost made him feel almost
      mad, and for fear that his uncle might notice that he was not himself, he
      determined to hide his mad longing for revenge under a pretended madness
      in other matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he met Ophelia, who loved him--and to whom he had given gifts,
      and letters, and many loving words--he behaved so wildly to her, that she
      could not but think him mad. For she loved him so that she could not
      believe he would be as cruel as this, unless he were quite mad. So she
      told her father, and showed him a pretty letter from Hamlet. And in the
      letter was much folly, and this pretty verse--
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Doubt that the stars are fire;
      </p>
      <p>
        Doubt that the sun doth move;
      </p>
      <p>
        Doubt truth to be a liar;
      </p>
      <p>
        But never doubt I love.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <br /> And from that time everyone believed that the cause of Hamlet's
      supposed madness was love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Hamlet was very unhappy. He longed to obey his father's ghost--and
      yet he was too gentle and kindly to wish to kill another man, even his
      father's murderer. And sometimes he wondered whether, after all, the ghost
      spoke truly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this time some actors came to the Court, and Hamlet ordered them
      to perform a certain play before the King and Queen. Now, this play was
      the story of a man <i>who had been murdered in his garden by a near
      relation, who afterwards married the dead man's wife.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      You may imagine the feelings of the wicked King, as he sat on his throne,
      with the Queen beside him and all his Court around, and saw, acted on the
      stage, the very wickedness that he had himself done. And when, in the
      play, the wicked relation poured poison into the ear of the sleeping man,
      the wicked Claudius suddenly rose, and staggered from the room--the Queen
      and others following.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then said Hamlet to his friends--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I am sure the ghost spoke true. For if Claudius had not done this
      murder, he could not have been so distressed to see it in a play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the Queen sent for Hamlet, by the King's desire, to scold him for his
      conduct during the play, and for other matters; and Claudius, wishing to
      know exactly what happened, told old Polonius to hide himself behind the
      hangings in the Queen's room. And as they talked, the Queen got frightened
      at Hamlet's rough, strange words, and cried for help, and Polonius behind
      the curtain cried out too. Hamlet, thinking it was the King who was hidden
      there, thrust with his sword at the hangings, and killed, not the King,
      but poor old Polonius.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now Hamlet had offended his uncle and his mother, and by bad hap killed
      his true love's father.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/hamlet2.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="hamlet2" id="hamlet2"></a> &ldquo;Oh! what a rash and bloody deed is
      this,&rdquo; cried the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Hamlet answered bitterly, &ldquo;Almost as bad as to kill a king, and marry
      his brother.&rdquo; Then Hamlet told the Queen plainly all his thoughts and how
      he knew of the murder, and begged her, at least, to have no more
      friendship or kindness of the base Claudius, who had killed the good King.
      And as they spoke the King's ghost again appeared before Hamlet, but the
      Queen could not see it. So when the ghost had gone, they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Queen told Claudius what had passed, and how Polonius was dead,
      he said, &ldquo;This shows plainly that Hamlet is mad, and since he has killed
      the Chancellor, it is for his own safety that we must carry out our plan,
      and send him away to England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Hamlet was sent, under charge of two courtiers who served the King, and
      these bore letters to the English Court, requiring that Hamlet should be
      put to death. But Hamlet had the good sense to get at these letters, and
      put in others instead, with the names of the two courtiers who were so
      ready to betray him. Then, as the vessel went to England, Hamlet escaped
      on board a pirate ship, and the two wicked courtiers left him to his fate,
      and went on to meet theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamlet hurried home, but in the meantime a dreadful thing had happened.
      Poor pretty Ophelia, having lost her lover and her father, lost her wits
      too, and went in sad madness about the Court, with straws, and weeds, and
      flowers in her hair, singing strange scraps of songs, and talking poor,
      foolish, pretty talk with no heart of meaning to it. And one day, coming
      to a stream where willows grew, she tried to bang a flowery garland on a
      willow, and fell into the water with all her flowers, and so died.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/hamlet3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="ophelia" id="ophelia"></a> And Hamlet had loved her, though his
      plan of seeming madness had made him hide it; and when he came back, he
      found the King and Queen, and the Court, weeping at the funeral of his
      dear love and lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ophelia's brother, Laertes, had also just come to Court to ask justice for
      the death of his father, old Polonius; and now, wild with grief, he leaped
      into his sister's grave, to clasp her in his arms once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I loved her more than forty thousand brothers,&rdquo; cried Hamlet, and leapt
      into the grave after him, and they fought till they were parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards Hamlet begged Laertes to forgive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not bear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that any, even a brother, should seem to
      love her more than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the wicked Claudius would not let them be friends. He told Laertes how
      Hamlet had killed old Polonius, and between them they made a plot to slay
      Hamlet by treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laertes challenged him to a fencing match, and all the Court were present.
      Hamlet had the blunt foil always used in fencing, but Laertes had prepared
      for himself a sword, sharp, and tipped with poison. And the wicked King
      had made ready a bowl of poisoned wine, which he meant to give poor Hamlet
      when he should grow warm with the sword play, and should call for drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Laertes and Hamlet fought, and Laertes, after some fencing, gave Hamlet
      a sharp sword thrust. Hamlet, angry at this treachery--for they had been
      fencing, not as men fight, but as they play--closed with Laertes in a
      struggle; both dropped their swords, and when they picked them up again,
      Hamlet, without noticing it, had exchanged his own blunt sword for
      Laertes' sharp and poisoned one. And with one thrust of it he pierced
      Laertes, who fell dead by his own treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the Queen cried out, &ldquo;The drink, the drink! Oh, my dear
      Hamlet! I am poisoned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had drunk of the poisoned bowl the King had prepared for Hamlet, and
      the King saw the Queen, whom, wicked as he was, he really loved, fall dead
      by his means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ophelia being dead, and Polonius, and the Queen, and Laertes, and the
      two courtiers who had been sent to England, Hamlet at last found courage
      to do the ghost's bidding and avenge his father's murder--which, if he had
      braced up his heart to do long before, all these lives had been spared,
      and none had suffered but the wicked King, who well deserved to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamlet, his heart at last being great enough to do the deed he ought,
      turned the poisoned sword on the false King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then--venom--do thy work!&rdquo; he cried, and the King died.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Hamlet in the end kept the promise he had made his father. And all
      being now accomplished, he himself died. And those who stood by saw him
      die, with prayers and tears, for his friends and his people loved him with
      their whole hearts. Thus ends the tragic tale of Hamlet, Prince of
      Denmark.

      <br />
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="cymbeline" id="cymbeline">CYMBELINE</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> Cymbeline was the King of Britain. He had three children. The two
      sons were stolen away from him when they were quite little children, and
      he was left with only one daughter, Imogen. The King married a second
      time, and brought up Leonatus, the son of a dear friend, as Imogen's
      playfellow; and when Leonatus was old enough, Imogen secretly married him.
      This made the King and Queen very angry, and the King, to punish Leonatus,
      banished him from Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Imogen was nearly heart-broken at parting from Leonatus, and he was
      not less unhappy. For they were not only lovers and husband and wife, but
      they had been friends and comrades ever since they were quite little
      children. With many tears and kisses they said &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo; They promised
      never to forget each other, and that they would never care for anyone else
      as long as they lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This diamond was my mother's, love,&rdquo; said Imogen; &ldquo;take it, my heart, and
      keep it as long as you love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetest, fairest,&rdquo; answered Leonatus, &ldquo;wear this bracelet for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Imogen, weeping, &ldquo;when shall we meet again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while they were still in each other's arms, the King came in, and
      Leonatus had to leave without more farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/cymbel2.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="imogen" id="imogen"></a> When he was come to Rome, where he had
      gone to stay with an old friend of his father's, he spent his days still
      in thinking of his dear Imogen, and his nights in dreaming of her. One day
      at a feast some Italian and French noblemen were talking of their
      sweethearts, and swearing that they were the most faithful and honorable
      and beautiful ladies in the world. And a Frenchman reminded Leonatus how
      he had said many times that his wife Imogen was more fair, wise, and
      constant than any of the ladies in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say so still,&rdquo; said Leonatus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not so good but that she would deceive,&rdquo; said Iachimo, one of the
      Italian nobles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never would deceive,&rdquo; said Leonatus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wager,&rdquo; said Iachimo, &ldquo;that, if I go to Britain, I can persuade your
      wife to do whatever I wish, even if it should be against your wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you will never do,&rdquo; said Leonatus. &ldquo;I wager this ring upon my
      finger,&rdquo; which was the very ring Imogen had given him at parting, &ldquo;that my
      wife will keep all her vows to me, and that you will never persuade her to
      do otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Iachimo wagered half his estate against the ring on Leonatus's finger,
      and started forthwith for Britain, with a letter of introduction to
      Leonatus's wife. When he reached there he was received with all kindness;
      but he was still determined to win his wager.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told Imogen that her husband thought no more of her, and went on to
      tell many cruel lies about him. Imogen listened at first, but presently
      perceived what a wicked person Iachimo was, and ordered him to leave her.
      Then he said--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, fair lady, all that I have said is untrue. I only told you
      this to see whether you would believe me, or whether you were as much to
      be trusted as your husband thinks. Will you forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive you freely,&rdquo; said Imogen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; went on Iachimo, &ldquo;perhaps you will prove it by taking charge of a
      trunk, containing a number of jewels which your husband and I and some
      other gentlemen have bought as a present for the Emperor of Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will indeed,&rdquo; said Imogen, &ldquo;do anything for my husband and a friend of
      my husband's. Have the jewels sent into my room, and I will take care of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only for one night,&rdquo; said Iachimo, &ldquo;for I leave Britain again
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/cymbel3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="trunk" id="trunk"></a> So the trunk was carried into Imogen's
      room, and that night she went to bed and to sleep. When she was fast
      asleep, the lid of the trunk opened and a man got out. It was Iachimo. The
      story about the jewels was as untrue as the rest of the things he had
      said. He had only wished to get into her room to win his wicked wager. He
      looked about him and noticed the furniture, and then crept to the side of
      the bed where Imogen was asleep and took from her arm the gold bracelet
      which had been the parting gift of her husband. Then he crept back to the
      trunk, and next morning sailed for Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he met Leonatus, he said--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been to Britain and I have won the wager, for your wife no longer
      thinks about you. She stayed talking with me all one night in her room,
      which is hung with tapestry and has a carved chimney-piece, and silver
      andirons in the shape of two winking Cupids.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe she has forgotten me; I do not believe she stayed
      talking with you in her room. You have heard her room described by the
      servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Iachimo, &ldquo;but she gave me this bracelet. She took it from her
      arm. I see her yet. Her pretty action did outsell her gift, and yet
      enriched it too. She gave it me, and said she prized it once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the ring,&rdquo; cried Leonatus, &ldquo;you have won; and you might have won my
      life as well, for I care nothing for it now I know my lady has forgotten
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And mad with anger, he wrote letters to Britain to his old servant,
      Pisanio, ordering him to take Imogen to Milford Haven, and to murder her,
      because she had forgotten him and given away his gift. At the same time he
      wrote to Imogen herself, telling her to go with Pisanio, his old servant,
      to Milford Haven, and that he, her husband, would be there to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when Pisanio got this letter he was too good to carry out its orders,
      and too wise to let them alone altogether. So he gave Imogen the letter
      from her husband, and started with her for Milford Haven. Before he left,
      the wicked Queen gave him a drink which, she said, would be useful in
      sickness. She hoped he would give it to Imogen, and that Imogen would die,
      and the wicked Queen's son could be King. For the Queen thought this drink
      was a poison, but really and truly it was only a sleeping-draft.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pisanio and Imogen came near to Milford Haven, he told her what was
      really in the letter he had had from her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go on to Rome, and see him myself,&rdquo; said Imogen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Pisanio helped her to dress in boy's clothes, and sent her on her
      way, and went back to the Court. Before he went he gave her the drink he
      had had from the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imogen went on, getting more and more tired, and at last came to a cave.
      Someone seemed to live there, but no one was in just then. So she went in,
      and as she was almost dying of hunger, she took some food she saw there,
      and had just done so, when an old man and two boys came into the cave. She
      was very much frightened when she saw them, for she thought that they
      would be angry with her for taking their food, though she had meant to
      leave money for it on the table. But to her surprise they welcomed her
      kindly. She looked very pretty in her boy's clothes and her face was good,
      as well as pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall be our brother,&rdquo; said both the boys; and so she stayed with
      them, and helped to cook the food, and make things comfortable. But one
      day when the old man, whose name was Bellarius, was out hunting with the
      two boys, Imogen felt ill, and thought she would try the medicine Pisanio
      had given her. So she took it, and at once became like a dead creature, so
      that when Bellarius and the boys came back from hunting, they thought she
      was dead, and with many tears and funeral songs, they carried her away and
      laid her in the wood, covered with flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sang sweet songs to her, and strewed flowers on her, pale primroses,
      and the azure harebell, and eglantine, and furred moss, and went away
      sorrowful. No sooner had they gone than Imogen awoke, and not knowing how
      she came there, nor where she was, went wandering through the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now while Imogen had been living in the cave, the Romans had decided to
      attack Britain, and their army had come over, and with them Leonatus, who
      had grown sorry for his wickedness against Imogen, so had come back, not
      to fight with the Romans against Britain, but with the Britons against
      Rome. So as Imogen wandered alone, she met with Lucius, the Roman General,
      and took service with him as his page.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the battle was fought between the Romans and Britons, Bellarius and
      his two boys fought for their own country, and Leonatus, disguised as a
      British peasant, fought beside them. The Romans had taken Cymbeline
      prisoner, and old Bellarius, with his sons and Leonatus, bravely rescued
      the King. Then the Britons won the battle, and among the prisoners brought
      before the King were Lucius, with Imogen, Iachimo, and Leonatus, who had
      put on the uniform of a Roman soldier. He was tired of his life since he
      had cruelly ordered his wife to be killed, and he hoped that, as a Roman
      soldier, he would be put to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were brought before the King, Lucius spoke out--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I must die, so be
      it. This one thing only will I entreat. My boy, a Briton born, let him be
      ransomed. Never master had a page so kind, so duteous, diligent, true. He
      has done no Briton harm, though he has served a Roman. Save him, Sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/cymbel4.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="stupefied" id="stupefied"></a> Then Cymbeline looked on the page,
      who was his own daughter, Imogen, in disguise, and though he did not
      recognize her, he felt such a kindness that he not only spared the boy's
      life, but he said--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall have any boon he likes to ask of me, even though he ask a
      prisoner, the noblest taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Imogen said, &ldquo;The boon I ask is that this gentleman shall say from
      whom he got the ring he has on his finger,&rdquo; and she pointed to Iachimo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said Cymbeline, &ldquo;how did you get that diamond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Iachimo told the whole truth of his villainy. At this, Leonatus was
      unable to contain himself, and casting aside all thought of disguise, he
      came forward, cursing himself for his folly in having believed Iachimo's
      lying story, and calling again and again on his wife whom he believed
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Imogen, my love, my life!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Oh, Imogen!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Imogen, forgetting she was disguised, cried out, &ldquo;Peace, my
      lord--here, here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/cymbel5.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html."  />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="leonatus" id="leonatus"></a> Leonatus turned to strike the
      forward page who thus interfered in his great trouble, and then he saw
      that it was his wife, Imogen, and they fell into each other's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King was so glad to see his dear daughter again, and so grateful to
      the man who had rescued him (whom he now found to be Leonatus), that he
      gave his blessing on their marriage, and then he turned to Bellarius, and
      the two boys. Now Bellarius spoke--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am your old servant, Bellarius. You accused me of treason when I had
      only been loyal to you, and to be doubted, made me disloyal. So I stole
      your two sons, and see,--they are here!&rdquo; And he brought forward the two
      boys, who had sworn to be brothers to Imogen when they thought she was a
      boy like themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wicked Queen was dead of some of her own poisons, and the King, with
      his three children about him, lived to a happy old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the wicked were punished, and the good and true lived happy ever after.
      So may the wicked suffer, and honest folk prosper till the world's end.

    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> When a person is asked to tell the story of Macbeth, he can tell two
      stories. One is of a man called Macbeth who came to the throne of Scotland
      by a crime in the year of our Lord 1039, and reigned justly and well, on
      the whole, for fifteen years or more. This story is part of Scottish
      history. The other story issues from a place called Imagination; it is
      gloomy and wonderful, and you shall hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year or two before Edward the Confessor began to rule England, a battle
      was won in Scotland against a Norwegian King by two generals named Macbeth
      and Banquo. After the battle, the generals walked together towards Forres,
      in Elginshire, where Duncan, King of Scotland, was awaiting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were crossing a lonely heath, they saw three bearded women,
      sisters, hand in hand, withered in appearance and wild in their attire.

      &ldquo;Hail, Macbeth, chieftain of Cawdor,&rdquo; said the second woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hail, Macbeth, King that is to be,&rdquo; said the third woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Banquo asked, &ldquo;What of me?&rdquo; and the third woman replied, &ldquo;Thou shalt
      be the father of kings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me more,&rdquo; said Macbeth. &ldquo;By my father's death I am chieftain of
      Glamis, but the chieftain of Cawdor lives, and the King lives, and his
      children live. Speak, I charge you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The women replied only by vanishing, as though suddenly mixed with the
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banquo and Macbeth knew then that they had been addressed by witches, and
      were discussing their prophecies when two nobles approached. One of them
      thanked Macbeth, in the King's name, for his military services, and the
      other said, &ldquo;He bade me call you chieftain of Cawdor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Macbeth then learned that the man who had yesterday borne that title was
      to die for treason, and he could not help thinking, &ldquo;The third witch
      called me, 'King that is to be.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/macb2.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="macbeth2" id="macbeth2"></a> &ldquo;Banquo,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you see that the
      witches spoke truth concerning me. Do you not believe, therefore, that
      your child and grandchild will be kings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Banquo frowned. Duncan had two sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, and he deemed
      it disloyal to hope that his son Fleance should rule Scotland. He told
      Macbeth that the witches might have intended to tempt them both into
      villainy by their prophecies concerning the throne. Macbeth, however,
      thought the prophecy that he should be King too pleasant to keep to
      himself, and he mentioned it to his wife in a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Macbeth was the grand-daughter of a King of Scotland who had died in
      defending his crown against the King who preceded Duncan, and by whose
      order her only brother was slain. To her, Duncan was a reminder of bitter
      wrongs. Her husband had royal blood in his veins, and when she read his
      letter, she was determined that he should be King.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a messenger arrived to inform her that Duncan would pass a night in
      Macbeth's castle, she nerved herself for a very base action.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told Macbeth almost as soon as she saw him that Duncan must spend a
      sunless morrow. She meant that Duncan must die, and that the dead are
      blind. &ldquo;We will speak further,&rdquo; said Macbeth uneasily, and at night, with
      his memory full of Duncan's kind words, he would fain have spared his
      guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you live a coward?&rdquo; demanded Lady Macbeth, who seems to have
      thought that morality and cowardice were the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/macb3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="macbeth3" id="macbeth3"></a> &ldquo;I dare do all that may become a man,&rdquo;
       replied Macbeth; &ldquo;who dare do more is none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you write that letter to me?&rdquo; she inquired fiercely, and with
      bitter words she egged him on to murder, and with cunning words she showed
      him how to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper Duncan went to bed, and two grooms were placed on guard at
      his bedroom door. Lady Macbeth caused them to drink wine till they were
      stupefied. She then took their daggers and would have killed the King
      herself if his sleeping face had not looked like her father's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Macbeth came later, and found the daggers lying by the grooms; and soon
      with red hands he appeared before his wife, saying, &ldquo;Methought I heard a
      voice cry, 'Sleep no more! Macbeth destroys the sleeping.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wash your hands,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Why did you not leave the daggers by the
      grooms? Take them back, and smear the grooms with blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not,&rdquo; said Macbeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife dared, and she returned to him with hands red as his own, but a
      heart less white, she proudly told him, for she scorned his fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murderers heard a knocking, and Macbeth wished it was a knocking which
      could wake the dead. It was the knocking of Macduff, the chieftain of
      Fife, who had been told by Duncan to visit him early. Macbeth went to him,
      and showed him the door of the King's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/macb4.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="macbeth4" id="macbeth4"></a> Macduff entered, and came out again
      crying, &ldquo;O horror! horror! horror!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Macbeth appeared as horror-stricken as Macduff, and pretending that he
      could not bear to see life in Duncan's murderers, he slew the two grooms
      with their own daggers before they could proclaim their innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      These murders did not shriek out, and Macbeth was crowned at Scone. One of
      Duncan's sons went to Ireland, the other to England. Macbeth was King. But
      he was discontented. The prophecy concerning Banquo oppressed his mind. If
      Fleance were to rule, a son of Macbeth would not rule. Macbeth determined,
      therefore, to murder both Banquo and his son. He hired two ruffians, who
      slew Banquo one night when he was on his way with Fleance to a banquet
      which Macbeth was giving to his nobles. Fleance escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Macbeth and his Queen received their guests very graciously, and
      he expressed a wish for them which has been uttered thousands of times
      since his day--&ldquo;Now good digestion wait on appetite, and health on both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We pray your Majesty to sit with us,&rdquo; said Lennox, a Scotch noble; but
      ere Macbeth could reply, the ghost of Banquo entered the banqueting hall
      and sat in Macbeth's place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not noticing the ghost, Macbeth observed that, if Banquo were present, he
      could say that he had collected under his roof the choicest chivalry of
      Scotland. Macduff, however, had curtly declined his invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King was again pressed to take a seat, and Lennox, to whom Banquo's
      ghost was invisible, showed him the chair where it sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Macbeth, with his eyes of genius, saw the ghost. He saw it like a form
      of mist and blood, and he demanded passionately, &ldquo;Which of you have done
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still none saw the ghost but he, and to the ghost Macbeth said, &ldquo;Thou
      canst not say I did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ghost glided out, and Macbeth was impudent enough to raise a glass of
      wine &ldquo;to the general joy of the whole table, and to our dear friend
      Banquo, whom we miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The toast was drunk as the ghost of Banquo entered for the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begone!&rdquo; cried Macbeth. &ldquo;You are senseless, mindless! Hide in the earth,
      thou horrible shadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again none saw the ghost but he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it your Majesty sees?&rdquo; asked one of the nobles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen dared not permit an answer to be given to this question. She
      hurriedly begged her guests to quit a sick man who was likely to grow
      worse if he was obliged to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Macbeth, however, was well enough next day to converse with the witches
      whose prophecies had so depraved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found them in a cavern on a thunderous day. They were revolving round a
      cauldron in which were boiling particles of many strange and horrible
      creatures, and they knew he was coming before he arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me what I ask you,&rdquo; said the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you rather hear it from us or our masters?&rdquo; asked the first witch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call them,&rdquo; replied Macbeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the witches poured blood into the cauldron and grease into the
      flame that licked it, and a helmeted head appeared with the visor on, so
      that Macbeth could only see its eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was speaking to the head, when the first witch said gravely, &ldquo;He knows
      thy thought,&rdquo; and a voice in the head said, &ldquo;Macbeth, beware Macduff, the
      chieftain of Fife.&rdquo; The head then descended Into the cauldron till it
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more,&rdquo; pleaded Macbeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not be commanded,&rdquo; said the first witch, and then a crowned child
      ascended from the cauldron bearing a tree in his hand The child said--
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Macbeth shall be unconquerable till
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wood of Birnam climbs Dunsinane Hill.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will never be,&rdquo; said Macbeth; and he asked to be told if Banquo's
      descendants would ever rule Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cauldron sank into the earth; music was heard, and a procession of
      phantom kings filed past Macbeth; behind them was Banquo's ghost. In each
      king, Macbeth saw a likeness to Banquo, and he counted eight kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he was suddenly left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      His next proceeding was to send murderers to Macduff's castle. They did
      not find Macduff, and asked Lady Macduff where he was. She gave a stinging
      answer, and her questioner called Macduff a traitor. &ldquo;Thou liest!&rdquo; shouted
      Macduff's little son, who was immediately stabbed, and with his last
      breath entreated his mother to fly. The murderers did not leave the castle
      while one of its inmates remained alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Macduff was in England listening, with Malcolm, to a doctor's tale of
      cures wrought by Edward the Confessor when his friend Ross came to tell
      him that his wife and children were no more. At first Ross dared not speak
      the truth, and turn Macduff's bright sympathy with sufferers relieved by
      royal virtue into sorrow and hatred. But when Malcolm said that England
      was sending an army into Scotland against Macbeth, Ross blurted out his
      news, and Macduff cried, &ldquo;<i>All</i> dead, did you say? <i>All</i> my
      pretty ones and their mother? Did you say <i>all</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sorry hope was in revenge, but if he could have looked into Macbeth's
      castle on Dunsinane Hill, he would have seen at work a force more solemn
      than revenge. Retribution was working, for Lady Macbeth was mad. She
      walked in her sleep amid ghastly dreams. She was wont to wash her hands
      for a quarter of an hour at a time; but after all her washing, would still
      see a red spot of blood upon her skin. It was pitiful to hear her cry that
      all the perfumes of Arabia could not sweeten her little hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased?&rdquo; inquired Macbeth of the
      doctor, but the doctor replied that his patient must minister to her own
      mind. This reply gave Macbeth a scorn of medicine. &ldquo;Throw physic to the
      dogs,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I'll none of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day he heard a sound of women crying. An officer approached him and
      said, &ldquo;The Queen, your Majesty, is dead.&rdquo; &ldquo;Out, brief candle,&rdquo; muttered
      Macbeth, meaning that life was like a candle, at the mercy of a puff of
      air. He did not weep; he was too familiar with death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a messenger told him that he saw Birnam Wood on the march.
      Macbeth called him a liar and a slave, and threatened to hang him if he
      had made a mistake. &ldquo;If you are right you can hang me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/macb5.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="fight2" id="fight2"></a> From the turret windows of Dunsinane
      Castle, Birnam Wood did indeed appear to be marching. Every soldier of the
      English army held aloft a bough which he had cut from a tree in that wood,
      and like human trees they climbed Dunsinane Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Macbeth had still his courage. He went to battle to conquer or die, and
      the first thing he did was to kill the English general's son in single
      combat. Macbeth then felt that no man could fight him and live, and when
      Macduff came to him blazing for revenge, Macbeth said to him, &ldquo;Go back; I
      have spilt too much of your blood already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My voice is in my sword,&rdquo; replied Macduff, and hacked at him and bade him
      yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not yield!&rdquo; said Macbeth, but his last hour had struck. He fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Macbeth's men were in retreat when Macduff came before Malcolm holding a
      King's head by the hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hail, King!&rdquo; he said; and the new King looked at the old.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Malcolm reigned after Macbeth; but in years that came afterwards the
      descendants of Banquo were kings.

    <h2>
      <a name="comedy" id="comedy">THE COMEDY OF ERRORS</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> AEGEON was a merchant of Syracuse, which is a seaport in Sicily. His
      wife was AEmilia, and they were very happy until AEgeon's manager died,
      and he was obliged to go by himself to a place called Epidamnum on the
      Adriatic. As soon as she could AEmilia followed him, and after they had
      been together some time two baby boys were born to them. The babies were
      exactly alike; even when they were dressed differently they looked the
      same.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now you must believe a very strange thing. At the same inn where these
      children were born, and on the same day, two baby boys were born to a much
      poorer couple than AEmilia and AEgeon; so poor, indeed, were the parents
      of these twins that they sold them to the parents of the other twins.
    </p>
    <p>
      AEmilia was eager to show her children to her friends in Syracuse, and in
      treacherous weather she and AEgeon and the four babies sailed homewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were still far from Syracuse when their ship sprang a leak, and the
      crew left it in a body by the only boat, caring little what became of
      their passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      AEmilia fastened one of her children to a mast and tied one of the
      slave-children to him; AEgeon followed her example with the remaining
      children. Then the parents secured themselves to the same masts, and hoped
      for safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship, however, suddenly struck a rock and was split in two, and
      AEmilia, and the two children whom she had tied, floated away from AEgeon
      and the other children. AEmilia and her charges were picked up by some
      people of Epidamnum, but some fishermen of Corinth took the babies from
      her by force, and she returned to Epidanmum alone, and very miserable.
      Afterwards she settled in Ephesus, a famous town in Asia Minor.
    </p>
    <p>
      AEgeon and his charges were also saved; and, more fortunate than AEmilia,
      he was able to return to Syracuse and keep them till they were eighteen.
      His own child he called Antipholus, and the slavechild he called Dromio;
      and, strangely enough, these were the names given to the children who
      floated away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of eighteen the son who was with AEgeon grew restless with a
      desire to find his brother. AEgeon let him depart with his servant, and
      the young men are henceforth known as Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of
      Syracuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/errors1.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="dromio" id="dromio"></a> Let alone, AEgeon found his home too dreary
      to dwell in, and traveled for five years. He did not, during his absence,
      learn all the news of Syracuse, or he would never have gone to Ephesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was, his melancholy wandering ceased in that town, where he was
      arrested almost as soon as he arrived. He then found that the Duke of
      Syracuse had been acting in so tyrannical a manner to Ephesians unlucky
      enough to fall into his hands, that the Government of Ephesus had angrily
      passed a law which punished by death or a fine of a thousand pounds any
      Syracusan who should come to Ephesus. AEgeon was brought before Solinus,
      Duke of Ephesus, who told him that he must die or pay a thousand pounds
      before the end of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will think there was fate in this when I tell you that the children
      who were kidnaped by the fishermen of Corinth were now citizens of
      Ephesus, whither they had been brought by Duke Menaphon, an uncle of Duke
      Solinus. They will henceforth be called Antipholus of Ephesus and Dromio
      of Ephesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, on the very day when AEgeon was arrested, Antipholus of Syracuse
      landed in Ephesus and pretended that he came from Epidamnum in order to
      avoid a penalty. He handed his money to his servant Dromio of Syracuse,
      and bade him take it to the Centaur Inn and remain there till he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than ten minutes he was met on the Mart by Dromio of Ephesus, his
      brother's slave, and immediately mistook him for his own Dromio. &ldquo;Why are
      you back so soon? Where did you leave the money?&rdquo; asked Antipholus of
      Syracuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Drornio knew of no money except sixpence, which he had received on
      the previous Wednesday and given to the saddler; but he did know that his
      mistress was annoyed because his master was not in to dinner, and he asked
      Antipholus of Syracuse to go to a house called The Phoenix without delay.
      His speech angered the hearer, who would have beaten him if he had not
      fled. Antipholus of Syracuse them went to The Centaur, found that his gold
      had been deposited there, and walked out of the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wandering about Ephesus when two beautiful ladies signaled to him
      with their hands. They were sisters, and their names were Adriana and
      Luciana. Adriana was the wife of his brother Antipholus of Ephesus, and
      she had made up her mind, from the strange account given her by Dromio of
      Ephesus, that her husband preferred another woman to his wife. &ldquo;Ay, you
      may look as if you did not know me,&rdquo; she said to the man who was really
      her brother-in-law, &ldquo;but I can remember when no words were sweet unless I
      said them, no meat flavorsome unless I carved it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it I you address?&rdquo; said Antipholus of Syracuse stiffly. &ldquo;I do not know
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie, brother,&rdquo; said Luciana. &ldquo;You know perfectly well that she sent
      Dromio to you to bid you come to dinner;&rdquo; and Adriana said, &ldquo;Come, come; I
      have been made a fool of long enough. My truant husband shall dine with me
      and confess his silly pranks and be forgiven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were determined ladies, and Antipholus of Syracuse grew weary of
      disputing with them, and followed them obediently to The Phoenix, where a
      very late &ldquo;mid-day&rdquo; dinner awaited them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were at dinner when Antipholus of Ephesus and his slave Dromio
      demanded admittance. &ldquo;Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cecily, Gillian, Ginn!&rdquo;
       shouted Dromio of Ephesus, who knew all his fellow-servants' names by
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      From within came the reply, &ldquo;Fool, dray-horse, coxcomb, idiot!&rdquo; It was
      Dromio of Syracuse unconsciously insulting his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master and man did their best to get in, short of using a crowbar, and
      finally went away; but Antipholus of Ephesus felt so annoyed with his wife
      that he decided to give a gold chain which he had promised her, to another
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside The Phoenix, Luciana, who believed Antipholus of Syracuse to be her
      sister's husband, attempted, by a discourse in rhyme, when alone with him,
      to make him kinder to Adriana. In reply he told her that he was not
      married, but that he loved her so much that, if Luciana were a mermaid, he
      would gladly lie on the sea if he might feel beneath him her floating
      golden hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luciana was shocked and left him, and reported his lovemaking to Adriana,
      who said that her husband was old and ugly, and not fit to be seen or
      heard, though secretly she was very fond of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antipholus of Syracuse soon received a visitor in the shape of Angelo the
      goldsmith, of whom Antipholus of Ephesus had ordered the chain which he
      had promised his wife and intended to give to another woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goldsmith handed the chain to Antipholus of Syracuse, and treated his
      &ldquo;I bespoke it not&rdquo; as mere fun, so that the puzzled merchant took the
      chain as good-humoredly as he had partaken of Adriana's dinner. He offered
      payment, but Angelo foolishly said he would call again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/errors2.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="syracuse" id="syracuse"></a> The consequence was that Angelo was
      without money when a creditor of the sort that stands no nonsense,
      threatened him with arrest unless he paid his debt immediately. This
      creditor had brought a police officer with him, and Angelo was relieved to
      see Antipholus of Ephesus coming out of the house where he had been dining
      because he had been locked out of The Phoenix. Bitter was Angelo's dismay
      when Antipholus denied receipt of the chain. Angelo could have sent his
      mother to prison if she had said that, and he gave Antipholus of Ephesus
      in charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment up came Dromio of Syracuse and told the wrong Antipholus
      that he had shipped his goods, and that a favorable wind was blowing. To
      the ears of Antipholus of Ephesus this talk was simple nonsense. He would
      gladly have beaten the slave, but contented himself with crossly telling
      him to hurry to Adriana and bid her send to her arrested husband a purse
      of money which she would find in his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Adriana was furious with her husband because she thought he had
      been making love to her sister, she did not prevent Luciana from getting
      the purse, and she bade Dromio of Syracuse bring home his master
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, before Dromio could reach the police station he met his
      real master, who had never been arrested, and did not understand what he
      meant by offering him a purse. Antipholus of Syracuse was further
      surprised when a lady whom he did not know asked him for a chain that he
      had promised her. She was, of course, the lady with whom Antipholus of
      Ephesus had dined when his brother was occupying his place at table.
      &ldquo;Avaunt, thou witch!&rdquo; was the answer which, to her astonishment, she
      received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Antipholus of Ephesus waited vainly for the money which was to
      have released him. Never a good-tempered man, he was crazy with anger when
      Dromio of Ephesus, who, of course, had not been instructed to fetch a
      purse, appeared with nothing more useful than a rope. He beat the slave in
      the street despite the remonstrance of the police officer; and his temper
      did not mend when Adriana, Luciana, and a doctor arrived under the
      impression that he was mad and must have his pulse felt. He raged so much
      that men came forward to bind him. But the kindness of Adriana spared him
      this shame. She promised to pay the sum demanded of him, and asked the
      doctor to lead him to The Phoenix.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/errors3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="syracuse2" id="syracuse2"></a> Angelo's merchant creditor being
      paid, the two were friendly again, and might soon have been seen chatting
      before an abbey about the odd behavior of Antipholus of Ephesus. &ldquo;Softly,&rdquo;
       said the merchant at last, &ldquo;that's he, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not; it was Antipholus of Syracuse with his servant Dromio, and he
      wore Angelo's chain round his neck! The reconciled pair fairly pounced
      upon him to know what he meant by denying the receipt of the chain he had
      the impudence to wear. Antipholus of Syracuse lost his temper, and drew
      his sword, and at that moment Adriana and several others appeared. &ldquo;Hold!&rdquo;
       shouted the careful wife. &ldquo;Hurt him not; he is mad. Take his sword away.
      Bind him--and Dromio too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dromio of Syracuse did not wish to be bound, and he said to his master,
      &ldquo;Run, master! Into that abbey, quick, or we shall be robbed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They accordingly retreated into the abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adriana, Luciana, and a crowd remained outside, and the Abbess came out,
      and said, &ldquo;People, why do you gather here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To fetch my poor distracted husband,&rdquo; replied Adriana.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angelo and the merchant remarked that they had not known that he was mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adriana then told the Abbess rather too much about her wifely worries, for
      the Abbess received the idea that Adriana was a shrew, and that if her
      husband was distracted he had better not return to her for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adriana determined, therefore, to complain to Duke Solinus, and, lo and
      behold! a minute afterwards the great man appeared with officers and two
      others. The others were AEgeon and the headsman. The thousand marks had
      not been found, and AEgeon's fate seemed sealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere the Duke could pass the abbey Adriana knelt before him, and told a
      woeful tale of a mad husband rushing about stealing jewelry and drawing
      his sword, adding that the Abbess refused to allow her to lead him home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke bade the Abbess be summoned, and no sooner had he given the order
      than a servant from The Phoenix ran to Adriana with the tale that his
      master had singed off the doctor's beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Adriana, &ldquo;he's in the abbey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sure as I live I speak the truth,&rdquo; said the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antipholus of Syracuse had not come out of the abbey, before his brother
      of Ephesus prostrated himself in front of the Duke, exclaiming, &ldquo;Justice,
      most gracious Duke, against that woman.&rdquo; He pointed to Adriana. &ldquo;She has
      treated another man like her husband in my own house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/errors4.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="amelia" id="amelia"></a> Even while he was speaking AEgeon said,
      &ldquo;Unless I am delirious, I see my son Antipholus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one noticed him, and Antipholus of Ephesus went on to say how the
      doctor, whom he called &ldquo;a threadbare juggler,&rdquo; had been one of a gang who
      tied him to his slave Dromio, and thrust them into a vault whence he had
      escaped by gnawing through his bonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke could not understand how the same man who spoke to him was seen
      to go into the abbey, and he was still wondering when AEgeon asked
      Antipholus of Ephesus if he was not his son. He replied, &ldquo;I never saw my
      father in my life;&rdquo; but so deceived was AEgeon by his likeness to the
      brother whom he had brought up, that he said, &ldquo;Thou art ashamed to
      acknowledge me in misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon, however, the Abbess advanced with Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio
      of Syracuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then cried Adriana, &ldquo;I see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me;&rdquo; and
      Antipholus, espying his father, said, &ldquo;Thou art AEgeon or his ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a day of surprises, for the Abbess said, &ldquo;I will free that man by
      paying his fine, and gain my husband whom I lost. Speak, AEgeon, for I am
      thy wife AEmilia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was touched. &ldquo;He is free without a fine,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      So AEgeon and AEmilia were reunited, and Adriana and her husband
      reconciled; but no one was happier than Antipholus of Syracuse, who, in
      the Duke's presence, went to Luciana and said, &ldquo;I told you I loved you.
      Will you be my wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her answer was given by a look, and therefore is not written.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Dromios were glad to think they would receive no more beatings.

    <h2>
      <a name="venice" id="venice">THE MERCHANT OF VENICE</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> Antonio was a rich and prosperous merchant of Venice. His ships were
      on nearly every sea, and he traded with Portugal, with Mexico, with
      England, and with India. Although proud of his riches, he was very
      generous with them, and delighted to use them in relieving the wants of
      his friends, among whom his relation, Bassanio, held the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Bassanio, like many another gay and gallant gentleman, was reckless
      and extravagant, and finding that he had not only come to the end of his
      fortune, but was also unable to pay his creditors, he went to Antonio for
      further help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you, Antonio,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I owe the most in money and in love: and I
      have thought of a plan to pay everything I owe if you will but help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say what I can do, and it shall be done,&rdquo; answered his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then said Bassanio, &ldquo;In Belmont is a lady richly left, and from all
      quarters of the globe renowned suitors come to woo her, not only because
      she is rich, but because she is beautiful and good as well. She looked on
      me with such favor when last we met, that I feel sure that I should win
      her away from all rivals for her love had I but the means to go to
      Belmont, where she lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my fortunes,&rdquo; said Antonio, &ldquo;are at sea, and so I have no ready
      money; but luckily my credit is good in Venice, and I will borrow for you
      what you need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was living in Venice at this time a rich money-lender, named
      Shylock. Antonio despised and disliked this man very much, and treated him
      with the greatest harshness and scorn. He would thrust him, like a cur,
      over his threshold, and would even spit on him. Shylock submitted to all
      these indignities with a patient shrug; but deep in his heart he cherished
      a desire for revenge on the rich, smug merchant. For Antonio both hurt his
      pride and injured his business. &ldquo;But for him,&rdquo; thought Shylock, &ldquo;I should
      be richer by half a million ducats. On the market place, and wherever he
      can, he denounces the rate of interest I charge, and--worse than that--he
      lends out money freely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So when Bassanio came to him to ask for a loan of three thousand ducats to
      Antonio for three months, Shylock hid his hatred, and turning to Antonio,
      said--&ldquo;Harshly as you have treated me, I would be friends with you and
      have your love. So I will lend you the money and charge you no interest.
      But, just for fun, you shall sign a bond in which it shall be agreed that
      if you do not repay me in three months' time, then I shall have the right
      to a pound of your flesh, to be cut from what part of your body I choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Bassanio to his friend, &ldquo;you shall run no such risk for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, fear not,&rdquo; said Antonio, &ldquo;my ships will be home a month before the
      time. I will sign the bond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus Bassanio was furnished with the means to go to Belmont, there to woo
      the lovely Portia. The very night he started, the money-lender's pretty
      daughter, Jessica, ran away from her father's house with her lover, and
      she took with her from her father's hoards some bags of ducats and
      precious stones. Shylock's grief and anger were terrible to see. His love
      for her changed to hate. &ldquo;I would she were dead at my feet and the jewels
      in her ear,&rdquo; he cried. His only comfort now was in hearing of the serious
      losses which had befallen Antonio, some of whose ships were wrecked. &ldquo;Let
      him look to his bond,&rdquo; said Shylock, &ldquo;let him look to his bond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Bassanio had reached Belmont, and had visited the fair Portia.
      He found, as he had told Antonio, that the rumor of her wealth and beauty
      had drawn to her suitors from far and near. But to all of them Portia had
      but one reply. She would only accept that suitor who would pledge himself
      to abide by the terms of her father's will. These were conditions that
      frightened away many an ardent wooer. For he who would win Portia's heart
      and hand, had to guess which of three caskets held her portrait. If he
      guessed aright, then Portia would be his bride; if wrong, then he was
      bound by oath never to reveal which casket he chose, never to marry, and
      to go away at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/venice2.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="morocco" id="morocco"></a> The caskets were of gold, silver, and
      lead. The gold one bore this inscription:--&ldquo;Who chooseth me shall gain
      what many men desire;&rdquo; the silver one had this:--&ldquo;Who chooseth me shall
      get as much as he deserves;&rdquo; while on the lead one were these words:--&ldquo;Who
      chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.&rdquo; The Prince of Morocco, as
      brave as he was black, was among the first to submit to this test. He
      chose the gold casket, for he said neither base lead nor silver could
      contain her picture. So be chose the gold casket, and found inside the
      likeness of what many men desire--death.
    </p>
    <p>
      After him came the haughty Prince of Arragon, and saying, &ldquo;Let me have
      what I deserve--surely I deserve the lady,&rdquo; he chose the silver one, and
      found inside a fool's head. &ldquo;Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?&rdquo; he
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then at last came Bassanio, and Portia would have delayed him from making
      his choice from very fear of his choosing wrong. For she loved him dearly,
      even as he loved her. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Bassanio, &ldquo;let me choose at once, for,
      as I am, I live upon the rack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Portia bade her servants to bring music and play while her gallant
      lover made his choice. And Bassanio took the oath and walked up to the
      caskets--the musicians playing softly the while. &ldquo;Mere outward show,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;is to be despised. The world is still deceived with ornament, and
      so no gaudy gold or shining silver for me. I choose the lead casket; joy
      be the consequence!&rdquo; And opening it, he found fair Portia's portrait
      inside, and he turned to her and asked if it were true that she was his.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/venice3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="bond" id="bond"></a> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Portia, &ldquo;I am yours, and this house
      is yours, and with them I give you this ring, from which you must never
      part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Bassanio, saying that he could hardly speak for joy, found words to
      swear that he would never part with the ring while he lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly all his happiness was dashed with sorrow, for messengers
      came from Venice to tell him that Antonio was ruined, and that Shylock
      demanded from the Duke the fulfilment of the bond, under which he was
      entitled to a pound of the merchant's flesh. Portia was as grieved as
      Bassanio to hear of the danger which threatened his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;take me to church and make me your wife, and then go
      to Venice at once to help your friend. You shall take with you money
      enough to pay his debt twenty times over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when her newly-made husband had gone, Portia went after him, and
      arrived in Venice disguised as a lawyer, and with an introduction from a
      celebrated lawyer Bellario, whom the Duke of Venice had called in to
      decide the legal questions raised by Shylock's claim to a pound of
      Antonio's flesh. When the Court met, Bassanio offered Shylock twice the
      money borrowed, if he would withdraw his claim. But the money-lender's
      only answer was--
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If every ducat in six thousand ducats,
      </p>
      <p>
        Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,
      </p>
      <p>
        I would not draw them,--I would have my bond.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <br /> It was then that Portia arrived in her disguise, and not even her
      own husband knew her. The Duke gave her welcome on account of the great
      Bellario's introduction, and left the settlement of the case to her. Then
      in noble words she bade Shylock have mercy. But he was deaf to her
      entreaties. &ldquo;I will have the pound of flesh,&rdquo; was his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to say?&rdquo; asked Portia of the merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But little,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;I am armed and well prepared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Court awards you a pound of Antonio's flesh,&rdquo; said Portia to the
      money-lender.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/venice4.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="home" id="home"></a> &ldquo;Most righteous judge!&rdquo; cried Shylock. &ldquo;A
      sentence: come, prepare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tarry a little. This bond gives you no right to Antonio's blood, only to
      his flesh. If, then, you spill a drop of his blood, all your property will
      be forfeited to the State. Such is the Law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Shylock, in his fear, said, &ldquo;Then I will take Bassanio's offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Portia sternly, &ldquo;you shall have nothing but your bond. Take
      your pound of flesh, but remember, that if you take more or less, even by
      the weight of a hair, you will lose your property and your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shylock now grew very much frightened. &ldquo;Give me my three thousand ducats
      that I lent him, and let him go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bassanio would have paid it to him, but said Portia, &ldquo;No! He shall have
      nothing but his bond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/venice5.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="ring" id="ring"></a> &ldquo;You, a foreigner,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;have sought to
      take the life of a Venetian citizen, and thus by the Venetian law, your
      life and goods are forfeited. Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus were the tables turned, and no mercy would have been shown to Shylock
      had it not been for Antonio. As it was, the money-lender forfeited half
      his fortune to the State, and he had to settle the other half on his
      daughter's husband, and with this he had to be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bassanio, in his gratitude to the clever lawyer, was induced to part with
      the ring his wife had given him, and with which he had promised never to
      part, and when on his return to Belmont he confessed as much to Portia,
      she seemed very angry, and vowed she would not be friends with him until
      she had her ring again. But at last she told him that it was she who, in
      the disguise of the lawyer, had saved his friend's life, and got the ring
      from him. So Bassanio was forgiven, and made happier than ever, to know
      how rich a prize he had drawn in the lottery of the caskets.

    <h2>
      <a name="timon" id="timon">TIMON OF ATHENS</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> Four hundred years before the birth of Christ, a man lived in Athens
      whose generosity was not only great, but absurd. He was very rich, but no
      worldly wealth was enough for a man who spent and gave like Timon. If
      anybody gave Timon a horse, he received from Timon twenty better horses.
      If anybody borrowed money of Timon and offered to repay it, Timon was
      offended. If a poet had written a poem and Timon had time to read it, he
      would be sure to buy it; and a painter had only to hold up his canvas in
      front of Timon to receive double its market price.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flavius, his steward, looked with dismay at his reckless mode of life.
      When Timon's house was full of noisy lords drinking and spilling costly
      wine, Flavius would sit in a cellar and cry. He would say to himself,
      &ldquo;There are ten thousand candles burning in this house, and each of those
      singers braying in the concert-room costs a poor man's yearly income a
      night;&rdquo; and he would remember a terrible thing said by Apemantus, one of
      his master's friends, &ldquo;O what a number of men eat Timon, and Timon sees
      them not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/timon1.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="timon2" id="timon2"></a> Of course, Timon was much praised.
    </p>
    <p>
      A jeweler who sold him a diamond pretended that it was not quite perfect
      till Timon wore it. &ldquo;You mend the jewel by wearing it,&rdquo; he said. Timon
      gave the diamond to a lord called Sempronius, and the lord exclaimed, &ldquo;O,
      he's the very soul of bounty.&rdquo; &ldquo;Timon is infinitely dear to me,&rdquo; said
      another lord, called Lucullus, to whom he gave a beautiful horse; and
      other Athenians paid him compliments as sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Apemantus had listened to some of them, he said, &ldquo;I'm going to
      knock out an honest Athenian's brains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will die for that,&rdquo; said Timon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall die for doing nothing,&rdquo; said Apemantus. And now you know
      what a joke was like four hundred years before Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Apernantus was a frank despiser of mankind, but a healthy one,
      because he was not unhappy. In this mixed world anyone with a number of
      acquaintances knows a person who talks bitterly of men, but does not shun
      them, and boasts that he is never deceived by their fine speeches, and is
      inwardly cheerful and proud. Apemantus was a man like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timon, you will be surprised to hear, became much worse than Apemantus,
      after the dawning of a day which we call Quarter Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarter Day is the day when bills pour in. The grocer, the butcher, and
      the baker are all thinking of their debtors on that day, and the wise man
      has saved enough money to be ready for them. But Timon had not; and he did
      not only owe money for food. He owed it for jewels and horses and
      furniture; and, worst of all, he owed it to money-lenders, who expected
      him to pay twice as much as he had borrowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarter Day is a day when promises to pay are scorned, and on that day
      Timon was asked for a large sum of money. &ldquo;Sell some land,&rdquo; he said to his
      steward. &ldquo;You have no land,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Nonsense! I had a hundred,
      thousand acres,&rdquo; said Timon. &ldquo;You could have spent the price of the world
      if you had possessed it,&rdquo; said Flavius.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/timon2.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="picture" id="picture"></a> &ldquo;Borrow some then,&rdquo; said Timon; &ldquo;try
      Ventidius.&rdquo; He thought of Ventidius because he had once got Ventidius out
      of prison by paying a creditor of this young man. Ventidius was now rich.
      Timon trusted in his gratitude. But not for all; so much did he owe!
      Servants were despatched with requests for loans of money to several
      friends:
    </p>
    <p>
      One servant (Flaminius) went to Lucullus. When he was announced Lucullus
      said, &ldquo;A gift, I warrant. I dreamt of a silver jug and basin last night.&rdquo;
       Then, changing his tone, &ldquo;How is that honorable, free-hearted, perfect
      gentleman, your master, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well in health, sir,&rdquo; replied Flaminius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what have you got there under your cloak?&rdquo; asked Lucullus, jovially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, sir, nothing but an empty box, which, on my master's behalf, I beg
      you to fill with money, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La! la! la!&rdquo; said Lucullus, who could not pretend to mean, &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Your master's one fault is that he is too fond of giving parties. I've
      warned him that it was expensive. Now, look here, Flaminius, you know this
      is no time to lend money without security, so suppose you act like a good
      boy and tell him that I was not at home. Here's three solidares for
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back, wretched money,&rdquo; cried Flaminius, &ldquo;to him who worships you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Others of Timon's friends were tried and found stingy. Amongst them was
      Sempronius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; he said to Timon's servant, &ldquo;has he asked Ventidius? Ventidius is
      beholden to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you asked Lucullus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A poor compliment to apply to me last of all,&rdquo; said Sempronius, in
      affected anger. &ldquo;If he had sent to me at first, I would gladly have lent
      him money, but I'm not going to be such a fool as to lend him any now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your lordship makes a good villain,&rdquo; said the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Timon found that his friends were so mean, he took advantage of a
      lull in his storm of creditors to invite Ventidius and Company to a
      banquet. Flavius was horrified, but Ventidius and Company, were not in the
      least ashamed, and they assembled accordingly in Timon's house, and said
      to one another that their princely host had been jesting with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to put off an important engagement in order to come here,&rdquo; said
      Lucullus; &ldquo;but who could refuse Timon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/timon3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="box" id="box"></a> &ldquo;It was a real grief to me to be without ready
      money when he asked for some,&rdquo; said Sempronius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same here,&rdquo; chimed in a third lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timon now appeared, and his guests vied with one another in apologies and
      compliments. Inwardly sneering, Timon was gracious to them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the banqueting ball was a table resplendent with covered dishes. Mouths
      watered. These summer-friends loved good food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be seated, worthy friends,&rdquo; said Timon. He then prayed aloud to the gods
      of Greece. &ldquo;Give each man enough,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for if you, who are our gods,
      were to borrow of men they would cease to adore you. Let men love the
      joint more than the host. Let every score of guests contain twenty
      villains. Bless my friends as much as they have blessed me. Uncover the
      dishes, dogs, and lap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hungry lords were too much surprised by this speech to resent it. They
      thought Timon was unwell, and, although he had called them dogs, they
      uncovered the dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing in them but warm water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May you never see a better feast,&rdquo; wished Timon &ldquo;I wash off the
      flatteries with which you plastered me and sprinkle you with your
      villainy.&rdquo; With these words he threw the water into his guests' faces, and
      then he pelted them with the dishes. Having thus ended the banquet, he
      went into an outhouse, seized a spade, and quitted Athens for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      His next dwelling was a cave near the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all his friends, the only one who had not refused him aid was a
      handsome soldier named Alcibiades, and he had not been asked because,
      having quarreled with the Government of Athens, he had left that town. The
      thought that Alcibiades might have proved a true friend did not soften
      Timon's bitter feeling. He was too weak-minded to discern the fact that
      good cannot be far from evil in this mixed world. He determined to see
      nothing better in all mankind than the ingratitude of Ventidius and the
      meanness of Lucullus.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became a vegetarian, and talked pages to himself as he dug in the earth
      for food.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when he was digging for roots near the shore, his spade struck
      gold. If he had been a wise man he would have enriched himself quickly,
      and returned to Athens to live in comfort. But the sight of the gold vein
      gave no joy but only scorn to Timon. &ldquo;This yellow slave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will
      make and break religions. It will make black white and foul fair. It will
      buy murder and bless the accursed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was still ranting when Alcibiades, now an enemy of Athens, approached
      with his soldiers and two beautiful women who cared for nothing but
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timon was so changed by his bad thoughts and rough life that Alcibiades
      did not recognize him at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beast, as you are,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alcibiades knew his voice, and offered him help and money. But Timon would
      none of it, and began to insult the women. They, however, when they found
      he had discovered a gold mine, cared not a jot for his opinion of them,
      but said, &ldquo;Give us some gold, good Timon. Have you more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With further insults, Timon filled their aprons with gold ore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; said Alcibiades, who deemed that Timon's wits were lost; and
      then his disciplined soldiers left without profit the mine which could
      have paid their wages, and marched towards Athens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timon continued to dig and curse, and affected great delight when he dug
      up a root and discovered that it was not a grape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Apemantus appeared. &ldquo;I am told that you imitate me,&rdquo; said
      Apemantus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; said Timon, &ldquo;because you haven't a dog which I can imitate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are revenging yourself on your friends by punishing yourself,&rdquo; said
      Apemantus. &ldquo;That is very silly, for they live just as comfortably as they
      ever did. I am sorry that a fool should imitate me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/timon4.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="sullen" id="sullen"></a> &ldquo;If I were like you,&rdquo; said Timon, &ldquo;I should
      throw myself away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done so,&rdquo; sneered Apemantus. &ldquo;Will the cold brook make you a
      good morning drink, or an east wind warm your clothes as a valet would?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off with you!&rdquo; said Timon; but Apemantus stayed a while longer and told
      him he had a passion for extremes, which was true. Apemantus even made a
      pun, but there was no good laughter to be got out of Timon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, they lost their temper like two schoolboys, and Timon said he was
      sorry to lose the stone which he flung at Apemantus, who left him with an
      evil wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was almost an &ldquo;at home&rdquo; day for Timon, for when Apemantus had
      departed, he was visited by some robbers. They wanted gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want too much,&rdquo; said Timon. &ldquo;Here are water, roots and berries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not birds and pigs,&rdquo; said a robber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you are cannibals,&rdquo; said Timon. &ldquo;Take the gold, then, and may it
      poison you! Henceforth rob one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke so frightfully to them that, though they went away with full
      pockets, they almost repented of their trade. His last visitor on that day
      of visits was his good steward Flavius. &ldquo;My dearest master!&rdquo; cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away! What are you?&rdquo; said Timon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgotten me, sir?&rdquo; asked Flavius, mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have forgotten all men,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;and if you'll allow that you
      are a man, I have forgotten you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was your honest servant,&rdquo; said Flavius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! I never had an honest man about me,&rdquo; retorted Timon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flavius began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! shedding tears?&rdquo; said Timon. &ldquo;Come nearer, then. I will love you
      because you are a woman, and unlike men, who only weep when they laugh or
      beg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They talked awhile; then Timon said, &ldquo;Yon gold is mine. I will make you
      rich, Flavius, if you promise me to live by yourself and hate mankind. I
      will make you very rich if you promise me that you will see the flesh
      slide off the beggar's bones before you feed him, and let the debtor die
      in jail before you pay his debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flavius simply said, &ldquo;Let me stay to comfort you, my master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you dislike cursing, leave me,&rdquo; replied Timon, and he turned his back
      on Flavius, who went sadly back to Athens, too much accustomed to
      obedience to force his services upon his ailing master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward had accepted nothing, but a report got about that a mighty
      nugget of gold had been given him by his former master, and Timon
      therefore received more visitors. They were a painter and a poet, whom he
      had patronized in his prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hail, worthy Timon!&rdquo; said the poet. &ldquo;We heard with astonishment how your
      friends deserted you. No whip's large enough for their backs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have come,&rdquo; put in the painter, &ldquo;to offer our services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've heard that I have gold,&rdquo; said Timon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a report,&rdquo; said the painter, blushing; &ldquo;but my friend and I did
      not come for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good honest men!&rdquo; jeered Timon. &ldquo;All the same, you shall have plenty of
      gold if you will rid me of two villains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name them,&rdquo; said his two visitors in one breath. &ldquo;Both of you!&rdquo; answered
      Timon. Giving the painter a whack with a big stick, he said, &ldquo;Put that
      into your palette and make money out of it.&rdquo; Then he gave a whack to the
      poet, and said, &ldquo;Make a poem out of that and get paid for it. There's gold
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hurriedly withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Timon was visited by two senators who, now that Athens was
      threatened by Alcibiades, desired to have on their side this bitter noble
      whose gold might help the foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget your injuries,&rdquo; said the first senator. &ldquo;Athens offers you
      dignities whereby you may honorably live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Athens confesses that your merit was overlooked, and wishes to atone, and
      more than atone, for her forgetfulness,&rdquo; said the second senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worthy senators,&rdquo; replied Timon, in his grim way, &ldquo;I am almost weeping;
      you touch me so! All I need are the eyes of a woman and the heart of a
      fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the senators were patriots. They believed that this bitter man could
      save Athens, and they would not quarrel with him. &ldquo;Be our captain,&rdquo; they
      said, &ldquo;and lead Athens against Alcibiades, who threatens to destroy her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him destroy the Athenians too, for all I care,&rdquo; said Timon; and
      seeing an evil despair in his face, they left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The senators returned to Athens, and soon afterwards trumpets were blown
      before its walls. Upon the walls they stood and listened to Alcibiades,
      who told them that wrong-doers should quake in their easy chairs. They
      looked at his confident army, and were convinced that Athens must yield if
      he assaulted it, therefore they used the voice that strikes deeper than
      arrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These walls of ours were built by the hands of men who never wronged you,
      Alcibiades,&rdquo; said the first senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enter,&rdquo; said the second senator, &ldquo;and slay every tenth man, if your
      revenge needs human flesh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare the cradle,&rdquo; said the first senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask only justice,&rdquo; said Alcibiades. &ldquo;If you admit my army, I will
      inflict the penalty of your own laws upon any soldier who breaks them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a soldier approached Alcibiades, and said, &ldquo;My noble
      general, Timon is dead.&rdquo; He handed Alcibiades a sheet of wax, saying, &ldquo;He
      is buried by the sea, on the beach, and over his grave is a stone with
      letters on it which I cannot read, and therefore I have impressed them on
      wax.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alcibiades read from the sheet of wax this couplet--
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here lie I, Timon, who, alive,
      </p>
      <p>
        all living men did hate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pass by and say your worst; but pass,
      </p>
      <p>
        and stay not here your gait.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <br /> &ldquo;Dead, then, is noble Timon,&rdquo; said Alcibiades; and be entered Athens
      with an olive branch instead of a sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was one of Timon's friends who was generous in a greater matter than
      Timon's need; yet are the sorrow and rage of Timon remembered as a warning
      lest another ingratitude should arise to turn love into hate.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="othello" id="othello">OTHELLO</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> Four hundred years ago there lived in Venice an ensign named Iago,
      who hated his general, Othello, for not making him a lieutenant. Instead
      of Iago, who was strongly recommended, Othello had chosen Michael Cassio,
      whose smooth tongue had helped him to win the heart of Desdemona. Iago had
      a friend called Roderigo, who supplied him with money and felt he could
      not be happy unless Desdemona was his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Othello was a Moor, but of so dark a complexion that his enemies called
      him a Blackamoor. His life had been hard and exciting. He had been
      vanquished in battle and sold into slavery; and he had been a great
      traveler and seen men whose shoulders were higher than their heads. Brave
      as a lion, he had one great fault--jealousy. His love was a terrible
      selfishness. To love a woman meant with him to possess her as absolutely
      as he possessed something that did not live and think. The story of
      Othello is a story of jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/othello1.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="adventures" id="adventures"></a> One night Iago told Roderigo that
      Othello had carried off Desdemona without the knowledge of her father,
      Brabantio. He persuaded Roderigo to arouse Brabantio, and when that
      senator appeared Iago told him of Desdemona's elopement in the most
      unpleasant way. Though he was Othello's officer, he termed him a thief and
      a Barbary horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brabantio accused Othello before the Duke of Venice of using sorcery to
      fascinate his daughter, but Othello said that the only sorcery he used was
      his voice, which told Desdemona his adventures and hair-breadth escapes.
      Desdemona was led into the council-chamber, and she explained how she
      could love Othello despite his almost black face by saying, &ldquo;I saw
      Othello's visage in his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Othello had married Desdemona, and she was glad to be his wife, there
      was no more to be said against him, especially as the Duke wished him to
      go to Cyprus to defend it against the Turks. Othello was quite ready to
      go, and Desdemona, who pleaded to go with him, was permitted to join him
      at Cyprus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Othello's feelings on landing in this island were intensely joyful. &ldquo;Oh,
      my sweet,&rdquo; he said to Desdemona, who arrived with Iago, his wife, and
      Roderigo before him, &ldquo;I hardly know what I say to you. I am in love with
      my own happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      News coming presently that the Turkish fleet was out of action, he
      proclaimed a festival in Cyprus from five to eleven at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cassio was on duty in the Castle where Othello ruled Cyprus, so Iago
      decided to make the lieutenant drink too much. He had some difficulty, as
      Cassio knew that wine soon went to his head, but servants brought wine
      into the room where Cassio was, and Iago sang a drinking song, and so
      Cassio lifted a glass too often to the health of the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/othello2.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="othello2" id="othello2"></a> When Cassio was inclined to be
      quarrelsome, Iago told Roderigo to say something unpleasant to him. Cassio
      cudgeled Roderigo, who ran into the presence of Montano, the ex-governor.
      Montano civilly interceded for Roderigo, but received so rude an answer
      from Cassio that he said, &ldquo;Come, come, you're drunk!&rdquo; Cassio then wounded
      him, and Iago sent Roderigo out to scare the town with a cry of mutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The uproar aroused Othello, who, on learning its cause, said, &ldquo;Cassio, I
      love thee, but never more be officer of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On Cassio and Iago being alone together, the disgraced man moaned about
      his reputation. Iago said reputation and humbug were the same thing. &ldquo;O
      God,&rdquo; exclaimed Cassio, without heeding him, &ldquo;that men should put an enemy
      in their mouths to steal away their brains!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Iago advised him to beg Desdemona to ask Othello to pardon him. Cassio was
      pleased with the advice, and next morning made his request to Desdemona in
      the garden of the castle. She was kindness itself, and said, &ldquo;Be merry,
      Cassio, for I would rather die than forsake your cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cassio at that moment saw Othello advancing with Iago, and retired
      hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iago said, &ldquo;I don't like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; asked Othello, who felt that he had meant something
      unpleasant, but Iago pretended he had said nothing. &ldquo;Was not that Cassio
      who went from my wife?&rdquo; asked Othello, and Iago, who knew that it was
      Cassio and why it was Cassio, said, &ldquo;I cannot think it was Cassio who
      stole away in that guilty manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Desdemona told Othello that it was grief and humility which made Cassio
      retreat at his approach. She reminded him how Cassio had taken his part
      when she was still heart-free, and found fault with her Moorish lover.
      Othello was melted, and said, &ldquo;I will deny thee nothing,&rdquo; but Desdemona
      told him that what she asked was as much for his good as dining.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desdemona left the garden, and Iago asked if it was really true that
      Cassio had known Desdemona before her marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Othello.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Iago, as though something that had mystified him was now
      very clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he not honest?&rdquo; demanded Othello, and Iago repeated the adjective
      inquiringly, as though he were afraid to say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; insisted Othello.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Iago would only say the flat opposite of what he said to Cassio.
      He had told Cassio that reputation was humbug. To Othello he said, &ldquo;Who
      steals my purse steals trash, but he who filches from me my good name
      ruins me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Othello almost leapt into the air, and Iago was so confident of
      his jealousy that he ventured to warn him against it. Yes, it was no other
      than Iago who called jealousy &ldquo;the green-eyed monster which doth mock the
      meat it feeds on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Iago having given jealousy one blow, proceeded to feed it with the remark
      that Desdemona deceived her father when she eloped with Othello. &ldquo;If she
      deceived him, why not you?&rdquo; was his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Desdemona re-entered to tell Othello that dinner was ready. She
      saw that he was ill at ease. He explained it by a pain in his forehead.
      Desdemona then produced a handkerchief, which Othello had given her. A
      prophetess, two hundred years old, had made this handkerchief from the
      silk of sacred silkworms, dyed it in a liquid prepared from the hearts of
      maidens, and embroidered it with strawberries. Gentle Desdemona thought of
      it simply as a cool, soft thing for a throbbing brow; she knew of no spell
      upon it that would work destruction for her who lost it. &ldquo;Let me tie it
      round your head,&rdquo; she said to Othello; &ldquo;you will be well in an hour.&rdquo; But
      Othello pettishly said it was too small, and let it fall. Desdemona and he
      then went indoors to dinner, and Emilia picked up the handkerchief which
      Iago had often asked her to steal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was looking at it when Iago came in. After a few words about it he
      snatched it from her, and bade her leave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/othello3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="wine" id="wine"></a> In the garden he was joined by Othello, who
      seemed hungry for the worst lies he could offer. He therefore told Othello
      that he had seen Cassio wipe his mouth with a handkerchief, which, because
      it was spotted with strawberries, he guessed to be one that Othello had
      given his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy Moor went mad with fury, and Iago bade the heavens witness
      that he devoted his hand and heart and brain to Othello's service. &ldquo;I
      accept your love,&rdquo; said Othello. &ldquo;Within three days let me hear that
      Cassio is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Iago's next step was to leave Desdemona's handkerchief in Cassio's room.
      Cassio saw it, and knew it was not his, but he liked the strawberry
      pattern on it, and he gave it to his sweetheart Bianca and asked her to
      copy it for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iago's next move was to induce Othello, who had been bullying Desdemona
      about the handkerchief, to play the eavesdropper to a conversation between
      Cassio and himself. His intention was to talk about Cassio's sweetheart,
      and allow Othello to suppose that the lady spoken of was Desdemona.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, lieutenant?&rdquo; asked Iago when Cassio appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worse for being called what I am not,&rdquo; replied Cassio, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep on reminding Desdemona, and you'll soon be restored,&rdquo; said Iago,
      adding, in a tone too low for Othello to hear, &ldquo;If Bianca could set the
      matter right, how quickly it would mend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! poor rogue,&rdquo; said Cassio, &ldquo;I really think she loves me,&rdquo; and like
      the talkative coxcomb he was, Cassio was led on to boast of Bianca's
      fondness for him, while Othello imagined, with choked rage, that he
      prattled of Desdemona, and thought, &ldquo;I see your nose, Cassio, but not the
      dog I shall throw it to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Othello was still spying when Bianca entered, boiling over with the idea
      that Cassio, whom she considered her property, had asked her to copy the
      embroidery on the handkerchief of a new sweetheart. She tossed him the
      handkerchief with scornful words, and Cassio departed with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Othello had seen Bianca, who was in station lower, in beauty and speech
      inferior far, to Desdemona and he began in spite of himself to praise his
      wife to the villain before him. He praised her skill with the needle, her
      voice that could &ldquo;sing the savageness out of a bear,&rdquo; her wit, her
      sweetness, the fairness of her skin. Every time he praised her Iago said
      something that made him remember his anger and utter it foully, and yet he
      must needs praise her, and say, &ldquo;The pity of it, Iago! O Iago, the pity of
      it, Iago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was never in all Iago's villainy one moment of wavering. If there
      had been he might have wavered then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strangle her,&rdquo; he said; and &ldquo;Good, good!&rdquo; said his miserable dupe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pair were still talking murder when Desdemona appeared with a relative
      of Desdemona's father, called Lodovico, who bore a letter for Othello from
      the Duke of Venice. The letter recalled Othello from Cyprus, and gave the
      governorship to Cassio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckless Desdemona seized this unhappy moment to urge once more the suit
      of Cassio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire and brimstone!&rdquo; shouted Othello.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be the letter agitates him,&rdquo; explained Lodovico to Desdemona, and
      he told her what it contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; said Desdemona. It was the first bitter speech that Othello's
      unkindness had wrung out of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see you lose your temper,&rdquo; said Othello.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sweet Othello?&rdquo; she asked, sarcastically; and Othello slapped her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/othello4.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="handkerchief" id="handkerchief"></a> Now was the time for Desdemona
      to have saved her life by separation, but she knew not her peril--only
      that her love was wounded to the core. &ldquo;I have not deserved this,&rdquo; she
      said, and the tears rolled slowly down her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lodovico was shocked and disgusted. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this would not be
      believed in Venice. Make her amends;&rdquo; but, like a madman talking in his
      nightmare, Othello poured out his foul thought in ugly speech, and roared,
      &ldquo;Out of my sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not stay to offend you,&rdquo; said his wife, but she lingered even in
      going, and only when he shouted &ldquo;Avaunt!&rdquo; did she leave her husband and
      his guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Othello then invited Lodovico to supper, adding, &ldquo;You are welcome, sir, to
      Cyprus. Goats and monkeys!&rdquo; Without waiting for a reply he left the
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distinguished visitors detest being obliged to look on at family quarrels,
      and dislike being called either goats or monkeys, and Lodovico asked Iago
      for an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      True to himself, Iago, in a round-about way, said that Othello was worse
      than he seemed, and advised them to study his behavior and save him from
      the discomfort of answering any more questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded to tell Roderigo to murder Cassio. Roderigo was out of tune
      with his friend. He had given Iago quantities of jewels for Desdemona
      without effect; Desdemona had seen none of them, for Iago was a thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iago smoothed him with a lie, and when Cassio was leaving Bianca's house,
      Roderigo wounded him, and was wounded in return. Cassio shouted, and
      Lodovico and a friend came running up. Cassio pointed out Roderigo as his
      assailant, and Iago, hoping to rid himself of an inconvenient friend,
      called him &ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; and stabbed him, but not to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Castle, Desdemona was in a sad mood. She told Emilia that she must
      leave her; her husband wished it. &ldquo;Dismiss me!&rdquo; exclaimed Emilia. &ldquo;It was
      his bidding, said Desdemona; we must not displease him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sang a song which a girl had sung whose lover had been base to her--a
      song of a maiden crying by that tree whose boughs droop as though it
      weeps, and she went to bed and slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      She woke with her husband's wild eyes upon her. &ldquo;Have you prayed
      to-night?&rdquo; he asked; and he told this blameless and sweet woman to ask
      God's pardon for any sin she might have on her conscience. &ldquo;I would not
      kill thy soul,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her that Cassio had confessed, but she knew Cassio had nought to
      confess that concerned her. She said that Cassio could not say anything
      that would damage her. Othello said his mouth was stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/othello5.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="weeping" id="weeping"></a> Then Desdemona wept, but with violent
      words, in spite of all her pleading, Othello pressed upon her throat and
      mortally hurt her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with boding heart came Emilia, and besought entrance at the door, and
      Othello unlocked it, and a voice came from the bed saying, &ldquo;A guiltless
      death I die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; cried Emilia; and the voice said, &ldquo;Nobody--I myself.
      Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twas I that killed her,&rdquo; said Othello.
    </p>
    <p>
      He poured out his evidence by that sad bed to the people who came running
      in, Iago among them; but when he spoke of the handkerchief, Emilia told
      the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Othello knew. &ldquo;Are there no stones in heaven but thunderbolts?&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, and ran at Iago, who gave Emilia her death-blow and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they brought him back, and the death that came to him later on was a
      relief from torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would have taken Othello back to Venice to try him there, but he
      escaped them on his sword. &ldquo;A word or two before you go,&rdquo; he said to the
      Venetians in the chamber. &ldquo;Speak of me as I was--no better, no worse. Say
      I cast away the pearl of pearls, and wept with these hard eyes; and say
      that, when in Aleppo years ago I saw a Turk beating a Venetian, I took him
      by the throat and smote him thus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his own hand he stabbed himself to the heart; and ere he died his
      lips touched the face of Desdemona with despairing love.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="schrew" id="schrew">THE TAMING OF THE SHREW</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> There lived in Padua a gentleman named Baptista, who had two fair
      daughters. The eldest, Katharine, was so very cross and ill-tempered, and
      unmannerly, that no one ever dreamed of marrying her, while her sister,
      Bianca, was so sweet and pretty, and pleasant-spoken, that more than one
      suitor asked her father for her hand. But Baptista said the elder daughter
      must marry first.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Bianca's suitors decided among themselves to try and get some one to
      marry Katharine--and then the father could at least be got to listen to
      their suit for Bianca.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gentleman from Verona, named Petruchio, was the one they thought of,
      and, half in jest, they asked him if he would marry Katharine, the
      disagreeable scold. Much to their surprise he said yes, that was just the
      sort of wife for him, and if Katharine were handsome and rich, he himself
      would undertake soon to make her good-tempered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Petruchio began by asking Baptista's permission to pay court to his gentle
      daughter Katharine--and Baptista was obliged to own that she was anything
      but gentle. And just then her music master rushed in, complaining that the
      naughty girl had broken her lute over his head, because he told her she
      was not playing correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Petruchio, &ldquo;I love her better than ever, and long to
      have some chat with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/shrew2.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="master" id="master"></a> When Katharine came, he said, &ldquo;Good-morrow,
      Kate--for that, I hear, is your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've only heard half,&rdquo; said Katharine, rudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Petruchio, &ldquo;they call you plain Kate, and bonny Kate, and
      sometimes Kate the shrew, and so, hearing your mildness praised in every
      town, and your beauty too, I ask you for my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife!&rdquo; cried Kate. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; She said some extremely disagreeable
      things to him, and, I am sorry to say, ended by boxing his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do that again, I'll cuff you,&rdquo; he said quietly; and still
      protested, with many compliments, that he would marry none but her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Baptista came back, he asked at once--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How speed you with my daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I speed but well,&rdquo; replied Petruchio--&ldquo;how, but well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How now, daughter Katharine?&rdquo; the father went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/shrew3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="ears" id="ears"></a> &ldquo;I don't think,&rdquo; said Katharine, angrily, &ldquo;you
      are acting a father's part in wishing me to marry this mad-cap ruffian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Petruchio, &ldquo;you and all the world would talk amiss of her. You
      should see how kind she is to me when we are alone. In short, I will go
      off to Venice to buy fine things for our wedding--for--kiss me, Kate! we
      will be married on Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that, Katharine flounced out of the room by one door in a violent
      temper, and he, laughing, went out by the other. But whether she fell in
      love with Petruchio, or whether she was only glad to meet a man who was
      not afraid of her, or whether she was flattered that, in spite of her
      rough words and spiteful usage, he still desired her for his wife--she did
      indeed marry him on Sunday, as he had sworn she should.
    </p>
    <p>
      To vex and humble Katharine's naughty, proud spirit, he was late at the
      wedding, and when he came, came wearing such shabby clothes that she was
      ashamed to be seen with him. His servant was dressed in the same shabby
      way, and the horses they rode were the sport of everyone they passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, after the marriage, when should have been the wedding breakfast,
      Petruchio carried his wife away, not allowing her to eat or drink--saying
      that she was his now, and he could do as he liked with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And his manner was so violent, and he behaved all through his wedding in
      so mad and dreadful a manner, that Katharine trembled and went with him.
      He mounted her on a stumbling, lean, old horse, and they journeyed by
      rough muddy ways to Petruchio's house, he scolding and snarling all the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was terribly tired when she reached her new home, but Petruchio was
      determined that she should neither eat nor sleep that night, for he had
      made up his mind to teach his bad-tempered wife a lesson she would never
      forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he welcomed her kindly to his house, but when supper was served he
      found fault with everything--the meat was burnt, he said, and ill-served,
      and he loved her far too much to let her eat anything but the best. At
      last Katharine, tired out with her journey, went supperless to bed. Then
      her husband, still telling her how he loved her, and how anxious he was
      that she should sleep well, pulled her bed to pieces, throwing the pillows
      and bedclothes on the floor, so that she could not go to bed at all, and
      still kept growling and scolding at the servants so that Kate might see
      how unbeautiful a thing ill-temper was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, too, Katharine's food was all found fault with, and caught
      away before she could touch a mouthful, and she was sick and giddy for
      want of sleep. Then she said to one of the servants--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray thee go and get me some repast. I care not what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What say you to a neat's foot?&rdquo; said the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; eagerly; but the servant, who was in his master's
      secret, said he feared it was not good for hasty-tempered people. Would
      she like tripe?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring it me,&rdquo; said Katharine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think that is good for hasty-tempered people,&rdquo; said the servant.
      &ldquo;What do you say to a dish of beef and mustard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love it,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mustard is too hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, the beef, and let the mustard go,&rdquo; cried Katharine, who was
      getting hungrier and hungrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the servant, &ldquo;you must have the mustard, or you get no beef
      from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; cried Katharine, losing patience, &ldquo;let it be both, or one, or
      anything thou wilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; said the servant, &ldquo;the mustard without the beef!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Katharine saw he was making fun of her, and boxed his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Petruchio brought her some food--but she had scarcely begun to
      satisfy her hunger, before he called for the tailor to bring her new
      clothes, and the table was cleared, leaving her still hungry. Katharine
      was pleased with the pretty new dress and cap that the tailor had made for
      her, but Petruchio found fault with everything, flung the cap and gown on
      the floor vowing his dear wife should not wear any such foolish things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/shrew4.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="supper" id="supper"></a> &ldquo;I will have them,&rdquo; cried Katharine. &ldquo;All
      gentlewomen wear such caps as these--&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you are gentle you shall have one too,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and not till
      then.&rdquo; When he had driven away the tailor with angry words--but privately
      asking his friend to see him paid--Petruchio said--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Kate, let's go to your father's, shabby as we are, for as the sun
      breaks through the darkest clouds, so honor peereth in the meanest habit.
      It is about seven o'clock now. We shall easily get there by dinner-time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nearly two,&rdquo; said Kate, but civilly enough, for she had grown to see
      that she could not bully her husband, as she had done her father and her
      sister; &ldquo;it's nearly two, and it will be supper-time before we get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be seven,&rdquo; said Petruchio, obstinately, &ldquo;before I start. Why,
      whatever I say or do, or think, you do nothing but contradict. I won't go
      to-day, and before I do go, it shall be what o'clock I say it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last they started for her father's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the moon,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the sun,&rdquo; said Katharine, and indeed it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say it is the moon. Contradicting again! It shall be sun or moon, or
      whatever I choose, or I won't take you to your father's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Katharine gave in, once and for all. &ldquo;What you will have it named,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;it is, and so it shall be so for Katharine.&rdquo; And so it was, for
      from that moment Katharine felt that she had met her master, and never
      again showed her naughty tempers to him, or anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they journeyed on to Baptista's house, and arriving there, they found
      all folks keeping Bianca's wedding feast, and that of another newly
      married couple, Hortensio and his wife. They were made welcome, and sat
      down to the feast, and all was merry, save that Hortensio's wife, seeing
      Katharine subdued to her husband, thought she could safely say many
      disagreeable things, that in the old days, when Katharine was free and
      froward, she would not have dared to say. But Katharine answered with such
      spirit and such moderation, that she turned the laugh against the new
      bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, when the ladies had retired, Baptista joined in a laugh
      against Petruchio, saying &ldquo;Now in good sadness, son Petruchio, I fear you
      have got the veriest shrew of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong,&rdquo; said Petruchio, &ldquo;let me prove it to you. Each of us shall
      send a message to his wife, desiring her to come to him, and the one whose
      wife comes most readily shall win a wager which we will agree on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The others said yes readily enough, for each thought his own wife the most
      dutiful, and each thought he was quite sure to win the wager.
    </p>
    <p>
      They proposed a wager of twenty crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty crowns,&rdquo; said Petruchio, &ldquo;I'll venture so much on my hawk or
      hound, but twenty times as much upon my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred then,&rdquo; cried Lucentio, Bianca's husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Content,&rdquo; cried the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Lucentio sent a message to the fair Bianca bidding her to come to
      him. And Baptista said he was certain his daughter would come. But the
      servant coming back, said--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, my mistress is busy, and she cannot come.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's an answer for you,&rdquo; said Petruchio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may think yourself fortunate if your wife does not send you a worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, better,&rdquo; Petruchio answered. Then Hortensio said--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and entreat my wife to come to me at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh--if you <i>entreat</i> her,&rdquo; said Petruchio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; answered Hortensio, sharply, &ldquo;do what you can, yours will
      not be entreated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But now the servant came in, and said--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says you are playing some jest, she will not come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better and better,&rdquo; cried Petruchio; &ldquo;now go to your mistress and say I
      <i>command</i> her to come to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all began to laugh, saying they knew what her answer would be, and
      that she would not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly Baptista cried--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes Katharine!&rdquo; And sure enough--there she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you wish, sir?&rdquo; she asked her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your sister and Hortensio's wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking by the parlor fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fetch them here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone to fetch them, Lucentio said--
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a wonder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what it means,&rdquo; said Hortensio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means peace,&rdquo; said Petruchio, &ldquo;and love, and quiet life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Baptista, &ldquo;you have won the wager, and I will add another
      twenty thousand crowns to her dowry--another dowry for another
      daughter--for she is as changed as if she were someone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Petruchio won his wager, and had in Katharine always a loving wife and
      true, and now he had broken her proud and angry spirit he loved her well,
      and there was nothing ever but love between those two. And so they lived
      happy ever afterwards.

    <h2>
      <a name="measure" id="measure">MEASURE FOR MEASURE</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> More centuries ago than I care to say, the people of Vienna were
      governed too mildly. The reason was that the reigning Duke Vicentio was
      excessively good-natured, and disliked to see offenders made unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequence was that the number of ill-behaved persons in Vienna was
      enough to make the Duke shake his head in sorrow when his chief secretary
      showed him it at the end of a list. He decided, therefore, that wrongdoers
      must be punished. But popularity was dear to him. He knew that, if he were
      suddenly strict after being lax, he would cause people to call him a
      tyrant. For this reason he told his Privy Council that he must go to
      Poland on important business of state. &ldquo;I have chosen Angelo to rule in my
      absence,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this Angelo, although he appeared to be noble, was really a mean man.
      He had promised to marry a girl called Mariana, and now would have nothing
      to say to her, because her dowry had been lost. So poor Mariana lived
      forlornly, waiting every day for the footstep of her stingy lover, and
      loving him still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having appointed Angelo his deputy, the Duke went to a friar called Thomas
      and asked him for a friar's dress and instruction in the art of giving
      religious counsel, for he did not intend to go to Poland, but to stay at
      home and see how Angelo governed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angelo had not been a day in office when he condemned to death a young man
      named Claudio for an act of rash selfishness which nowadays would only be
      punished by severe reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claudio had a queer friend called Lucio, and Lucio saw a chance of freedom
      for Claudio if Claudio's beautiful sister Isabella would plead with
      Angelo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabella was at that time living in a nunnery. Nobody had won her heart,
      and she thought she would like to become a sister, or nun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Claudio did not lack an advocate.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ancient lord, Escalus, was for leniency. &ldquo;Let us cut a little, but not
      kill,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This gentleman had a most noble father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angelo was unmoved. &ldquo;If twelve men find me guilty, I ask no more mercy
      than is in the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angelo then ordered the Provost to see that Claudio was executed at nine
      the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the issue of this order Angelo was told that the sister of the
      condemned man desired to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admit her,&rdquo; said Angelo.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering with Lucio, the beautiful girl said, &ldquo;I am a woeful suitor to
      your Honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Angelo.
    </p>
    <p>
      She colored at his chill monosyllable and the ascending red increased the
      beauty of her face. &ldquo;I have a brother who is condemned to die,&rdquo; she
      continued. &ldquo;Condemn the fault, I pray you, and spare my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every fault,&rdquo; said Angelo, &ldquo;is condemned before it is committed. A fault
      cannot suffer. Justice would be void if the committer of a fault went
      free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would have left the court if Lucio had not whispered to her, &ldquo;You are
      too cold; you could not speak more tamely if you wanted a pin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Isabella attacked Angelo again, and when he said, &ldquo;I will not pardon
      him,&rdquo; she was not discouraged, and when he said, &ldquo;He's sentenced; 'tis too
      late,&rdquo; she returned to the assault. But all her fighting was with reasons,
      and with reasons she could not prevail over the Deputy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/measure1.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="dress" id="dress"></a> She told him that nothing becomes power like
      mercy. She told him that humanity receives and requires mercy from Heaven,
      that it was good to have gigantic strength, and had to use it like a
      giant. She told him that lightning rives the oak and spares the myrtle.
      She bade him look for fault in his own breast, and if he found one, to
      refrain from making it an argument against her brother's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angelo found a fault in his breast at that moment. He loved Isabella's
      beauty, and was tempted to do for her beauty what he would not do for the
      love of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared to relent, for he said, &ldquo;Come to me to-morrow before noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had, at any rate, succeeded in prolonging her brother's life for a few
      hours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In her absence Angelo's conscience rebuked him for trifling with his
      judicial duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Isabella called on him the second time, he said, &ldquo;Your brother cannot
      live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabella was painfully astonished, but all she said was, &ldquo;Even so. Heaven
      keep your Honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as she turned to go, Angelo felt that his duty and honor were slight
      in comparison with the loss of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your love,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and Claudio shall be freed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I would marry you, he should die if he had twenty heads to lay
      upon the block,&rdquo; said Isabella, for she saw then that he was not the just
      man he pretended to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she went to her brother in prison, to inform him that he must die. At
      first he was boastful, and promised to hug the darkness of death. But when
      he clearly understood that his sister could buy his life by marrying
      Angelo, he felt his life more valuable than her happiness, and he
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Sweet sister, let me live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the Duke came forward, in the habit of a friar, to request
      some speech with Isabella. He called himself Friar Lodowick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke then told her that Angelo was affianced to Mariana, whose
      love-story he related. He then asked her to consider this plan. Let
      Mariana, in the dress of Isabella, go closely veiled to Angelo, and say,
      in a voice resembling Isabella's, that if Claudio were spared she would
      marry him. Let her take the ring from Angelo's little finger, that it
      might be afterwards proved that his visitor was Mariana.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabella had, of course, a great respect for friars, who are as nearly
      like nuns as men can be. She agreed, therefore, to the Duke's plan. They
      were to meet again at the moated grange, Mariana's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/measure2.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="angelo" id="angelo"></a> In the street the Duke saw Lucio, who,
      seeing a man dressed like a friar, called out, &ldquo;What news of the Duke,
      friar?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have none,&rdquo; said the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucio then told the Duke some stories about Angelo. Then he told one about
      the Duke. The Duke contradicted him. Lucio was provoked, and called the
      Duke &ldquo;a shallow, ignorant fool,&rdquo; though he pretended to love him. &ldquo;The
      Duke shall know you better if I live to report you,&rdquo; said the Duke,
      grimly. Then he asked Escalus, whom he saw in the street, what he thought
      of his ducal master. Escalus, who imagined he was speaking to a friar,
      replied, &ldquo;The Duke is a very temperate gentleman, who prefers to see
      another merry to being merry himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke then proceeded to call on Mariana.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabella arrived immediately afterwards, and the Duke introduced the two
      girls to one another, both of whom thought he was a friar. They went into
      a chamber apart from him to discuss the saving of Claudio, and while they
      talked in low and earnest tones, the Duke looked out of the window and saw
      the broken sheds and flower-beds black with moss, which betrayed Mariana's
      indifference to her country dwelling. Some women would have beautified
      their garden: not she. She was for the town; she neglected the joys of the
      country. He was sure that Angelo would not make her unhappier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are agreed, father,&rdquo; said Isabella, as she returned with Mariana.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Angelo was deceived by the girl whom he had dismissed from his love,
      and put on her finger a ring he wore, in which was set a milky stone which
      flashed in the light with secret colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing of her success, the Duke went next day to the prison prepared to
      learn that an order had arrived for Claudio's release. It had not,
      however, but a letter was banded to the Provost while he waited. His
      amazement was great when the Provost read aloud these words, &ldquo;Whatsoever
      you may hear to the contrary, let Claudio be executed by four of the
      clock. Let me have his head sent me by five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Duke said to the Provost, &ldquo;You must show the Deputy another head,&rdquo;
       and he held out a letter and a signet. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are the hand and
      seal of the Duke. He is to return, I tell you, and Angelo knows it not.
      Give Angelo another head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Provost thought, &ldquo;This friar speaks with power. I know the Duke's
      signet and I know his hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said at length, &ldquo;A man died in prison this morning, a pirate of the age
      of Claudio, with a beard of his color. I will show his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pirate's head was duly shown to Angelo, who was deceived by its
      resemblance to Claudio's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke's return was so popular that the citizens removed the city gates
      from their hinges to assist his entry into Vienna. Angelo and Escalus duly
      presented themselves, and were profusely praised for their conduct of
      affairs in the Duke's absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, therefore, the more unpleasant for Angelo when Isabella,
      passionately angered by his treachery, knelt before the Duke, and cried
      for justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her story was told, the Duke cried, &ldquo;To prison with her for a
      slanderer of our right hand! But stay, who persuaded you to come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friar Lodowick,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows him?&rdquo; inquired the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, my lord,&rdquo; replied Lucio. &ldquo;I beat him because he spake against your
      Grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A friar called Peter here said, &ldquo;Friar Lodowick is a holy man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabella was removed by an officer, and Mariana came forward. She took off
      her veil, and said to Angelo, &ldquo;This is the face you once swore was worth
      looking on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bravely he faced her as she put out her hand and said, &ldquo;This is the hand
      which wears the ring you thought to give another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the woman,&rdquo; said Angelo. &ldquo;Once there was talk of marriage between
      us, but I found her frivolous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mariana here burst out that they were affianced by the strongest vows.
      Angelo replied by asking the Duke to insist on the production of Friar
      Lodowick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall appear,&rdquo; promised the Duke, and bade Escalus examine the missing
      witness thoroughly while he was elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the Duke re-appeared in the character of Friar Lodowick, and
      accompanied by Isabella and the Provost. He was not so much examined as
      abused and threatened by Escalus. Lucio asked him to deny, if he dared,
      that he called the Duke a fool and a coward, and had had his nose pulled
      for his impudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To prison with him!&rdquo; shouted Escalus, but as hands were laid upon him,
      the Duke pulled off his friar's hood, and was a Duke before them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said to Angelo, &ldquo;if you have any impudence that can yet serve
      you, work it for all it's worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediate sentence and death is all I beg,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you affianced to Mariana?&rdquo; asked the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; said Angelo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then marry her instantly,&rdquo; said his master. &ldquo;Marry them,&rdquo; he said to
      Friar Peter, &ldquo;and return with them here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come hither, Isabel,&rdquo; said the Duke, in tender tones. &ldquo;Your friar is now
      your Prince, and grieves he was too late to save your brother;&rdquo; but well
      the roguish Duke knew he had saved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O pardon me,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;that I employed my Sovereign in my trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are pardoned,&rdquo; he said, gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Angelo and his wife re-entered. &ldquo;And now, Angelo,&rdquo; said the
      Duke, gravely, &ldquo;we condemn thee to the block on which Claudio laid his
      head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O my most gracious lord,&rdquo; cried Mariana, &ldquo;mock me not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall buy a better husband,&rdquo; said the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/measure3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="prince" id="prince"></a> &ldquo;O my dear lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I crave no
      better man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabella nobly added her prayer to Mariana's, but the Duke feigned
      inflexibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provost,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how came it that Claudio was executed at an unusual
      hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afraid to confess the lie he had imposed upon Angelo, the Provost said, &ldquo;I
      had a private message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are discharged from your office,&rdquo; said the Duke. The Provost then
      departed. Angelo said, &ldquo;I am sorry to have caused such sorrow. I prefer
      death to mercy.&rdquo; Soon there was a motion in the crowd. The Provost
      re-appeared with Claudio. Like a big child the Provost said, &ldquo;I saved this
      man; he is like Claudio.&rdquo; The Duke was amused, and said to Isabella, &ldquo;I
      pardon him because he is like your brother. He is like my brother, too, if
      you, dear Isabel, will be mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was his with a smile, and the Duke forgave Angelo, and promoted the
      Provost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucio he condemned to marry a stout woman with a bitter tongue.

    <h2>
      <a name="verona" id="verona">TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> Only one of them was really a gentleman, as you will discover later.
      Their names were Valentine and Proteus. They were friends, and lived at
      Verona, a town in northern Italy. Valentine was happy in his name because
      it was that of the patron saint of lovers; it is hard for a Valentine to
      be fickle or mean. Proteus was unhappy in his name, because it was that of
      a famous shape-changer, and therefore it encouraged him to be a lover at
      one time and a traitor at another.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, Valentine told his friend that he was going to Milan. &ldquo;I'm not in
      love like you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and therefore I don't want to stay at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Proteus was in love with a beautiful yellow-haired girl called Julia, who
      was rich, and had no one to order her about. He was, however, sorry to
      part from Valentine, and he said, &ldquo;If ever you are in danger tell me, and
      I will pray for you.&rdquo; Valentine then went to Milan with a servant called
      Speed, and at Milan he fell in love with the Duke of Milan's daughter,
      Silvia.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Proteus and Valentine parted Julia had not acknowledged that she
      loved Proteus. Indeed, she had actually torn up one of his letters in the
      presence of her maid, Lucetta. Lucetta, however, was no simpleton, for
      when she saw the pieces she said to herself, &ldquo;All she wants is to be
      annoyed by another letter.&rdquo; Indeed, no sooner had Lucetta left her alone
      than Julia repented of her tearing, and placed between her dress and her
      heart the torn piece of paper on which Proteus had signed his name. So by
      tearing a letter written by Proteus she discovered that she loved him.
      Then, like a brave, sweet girl, she wrote to Proteus, &ldquo;Be patient, and you
      shall marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delighted with these words Proteus walked about, flourishing Julia's
      letter and talking to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; asked his father, Antonio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter from Valentine,&rdquo; fibbed Proteus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me read it,&rdquo; said Antonio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no news,&rdquo; said deceitful Proteus; &ldquo;he only says that he is very
      happy, and the Duke of Milan is kind to him, and that he wishes I were
      with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This fib had the effect of making Antonio think that his son should go to
      Milan and enjoy the favors in which Valentine basked. &ldquo;You must go
      to-morrow,&rdquo; he decreed. Proteus was dismayed. &ldquo;Give me time to get my
      outfit ready.&rdquo; He was met with the promise, &ldquo;What you need shall be sent
      after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It grieved Julia to part from her lover before their engagement was two
      days' old. She gave him a ring, and said, &ldquo;Keep this for my sake,&rdquo; and he
      gave her a ring, and they kissed like two who intend to be true till
      death. Then Proteus departed for Milan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Valentine was amusing Silvia, whose grey eyes, laughing at him
      under auburn hair, had drowned him in love. One day she told him that she
      wanted to write a pretty letter to a gentleman whom she thought well of,
      but had no time: would he write it? Very much did Valentine dislike
      writing that letter, but he did write it, and gave it to her coldly. &ldquo;Take
      it back,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you did it unwillingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was difficult to write such a letter for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/verona1.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="silvia" id="silvia"></a> &ldquo;Take it back,&rdquo; she commanded; &ldquo;you did not
      write tenderly enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentine was left with the letter, and condemned to write another; but
      his servant Speed saw that, in effect, the Lady Silvia had allowed
      Valentine to write for her a love-letter to Valentine's own self. &ldquo;The
      joke,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is as invisible as a weather-cock on a steeple.&rdquo; He meant
      that it was very plain; and he went on to say exactly what it was: &ldquo;If
      master will write her love-letters, he must answer them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the arrival of Proteus, he was introduced by Valentine to Silvia and
      afterwards, when they were alone, Valentine asked Proteus how his love for
      Julia was prospering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Proteus, &ldquo;you used to get wearied when I spoke of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; confessed Valentine, &ldquo;but it's different now. I can eat and drink
      all day with nothing but love on my plate and love in my cup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You idolize Silvia,&rdquo; said Proteus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is divine,&rdquo; said Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/verona2.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="theletter" id="theletter"></a> &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; remonstrated Proteus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if she's not divine,&rdquo; said Valentine, &ldquo;she is the queen of all
      women on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except Julia,&rdquo; said Proteus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear boy,&rdquo; said Valentine, &ldquo;Julia is not excepted; but I will grant that
      she alone is worthy to bear my lady's train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your bragging astounds me,&rdquo; said Proteus.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had seen Silvia, and he felt suddenly that the yellow-haired Julia
      was black in comparison. He became in thought a villain without delay, and
      said to himself what he had never said before--&ldquo;I to myself am dearer than
      my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would have been convenient for Valentine if Proteus had changed, by the
      power of the god whose name he bore, the shape of his body at the evil
      moment when he despised Julia in admiring Silvia. But his body did not
      change; his smile was still affectionate, and Valentine confided to him
      the great secret that Silvia had now promised to run away with him. &ldquo;In
      the pocket of this cloak,&rdquo; said Valentine, &ldquo;I have a silken rope ladder,
      with hooks which will clasp the window-bar of her room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Proteus knew the reason why Silvia and her lover were bent on flight. The
      Duke intended her to wed Sir Thurio, a gentlemanly noodle for whom she did
      not care a straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proteus thought that if he could get rid of Valentine he might make Silvia
      fond of him, especially if the Duke insisted on her enduring Sir Thurio's
      tiresome chatter. He therefore went to the Duke, and said, &ldquo;Duty before
      friendship! It grieves me to thwart my friend Valentine, but your Grace
      should know that he intends to-night to elope with your Grace's daughter.&rdquo;
       He begged the Duke not to tell Valentine the giver of this information,
      and the Duke assured him that his name would not be divulged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early that evening the Duke summoned Valentine, who came to him wearing a
      large cloak with a bulging pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said the Duke, &ldquo;my desire to marry my daughter to Sir Thurio?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Valentine. &ldquo;He is virtuous and generous, as befits a man
      so honored in your Grace's thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless she dislikes him,&rdquo; said the Duke. &ldquo;She is a peevish, proud,
      disobedient girl, and I should be sorry to leave her a penny. I intend,
      therefore, to marry again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentine bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know how the young people of to-day make love,&rdquo; continued the
      Duke, &ldquo;and I thought that you would be just the man to teach me how to win
      the lady of my choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jewels have been known to plead rather well,&rdquo; said Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tried them,&rdquo; said the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The habit of liking the giver may grow if your Grace gives her some
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chief difficulty,&rdquo; pursued the Duke, &ldquo;is this. The lady is promised
      to a young gentleman, and it is hard to have a word with her. She is, in
      fact, locked up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your Grace should propose an elopement,&rdquo; said Valentine. &ldquo;Try a rope
      ladder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/verona3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="serenade" id="serenade"></a> &ldquo;But how should I carry it?&rdquo; asked the
      Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rope ladder is light,&rdquo; said Valentine; &ldquo;You can carry it in a cloak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your Grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then yours will do. Kindly lend it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentine had talked himself into a trap. He could not refuse to lend his
      cloak, and when the Duke had donned it, his Grace drew from the pocket a
      sealed missive addressed to Silvia. He coolly opened it, and read these
      words: &ldquo;Silvia, you shall be free to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and here's the rope ladder. Prettily contrived, but
      not perfectly. I give you, sir, a day to leave my dominions. If you are in
      Milan by this time to-morrow, you die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Valentine was saddened to the core. &ldquo;Unless I look on Silvia in the
      day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is no day for me to look upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he went he took farewell of Proteus, who proved a hypocrite of the
      first order. &ldquo;Hope is a lover's staff,&rdquo; said Valentine's betrayer; &ldquo;walk
      hence with that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After leaving Milan, Valentine and his servant wandered into a forest near
      Mantua where the great poet Virgil lived. In the forest, however, the
      poets (if any) were brigands, who bade the travelers stand. They obeyed,
      and Valentine made so good an impression upon his captors that they
      offered him his life on condition that he became their captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept,&rdquo; said Valentine, &ldquo;provided you release my servant, and are not
      violent to women or the poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply was worthy of Virgil, and Valentine became a brigand chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      We return now to Julia, who found Verona too dull to live in since Proteus
      had gone. She begged her maid Lucetta to devise a way by which she could
      see him. &ldquo;Better wait for him to return,&rdquo; said Lucetta, and she talked so
      sensibly that Julia saw it was idle to hope that Lucetta would bear the
      blame of any rash and interesting adventure. Julia therefore said that she
      intended to go to Milan and dressed like a page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must cut off your hair then,&rdquo; said Lucetta, who thought that at this
      announcement Julia would immediately abandon her scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall knot it up,&rdquo; was the disappointing rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucetta then tried to make the scheme seem foolish to Julia, but Julia had
      made up her mind and was not to be put off by ridicule; and when her
      toilet was completed, she looked as comely a page as one could wish to
      see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia assumed the male name Sebastian, and arrived in Milan in time to
      hear music being performed outside the Duke's palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are serenading the Lady Silvia,&rdquo; said a man to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she heard a voice lifted in song, and she knew that voice. It was
      the voice of Proteus. But what was he singing?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who is Silvia? what is she,
      </p>
      <p>
        That all our swains commend her?
      </p>
      <p>
        Holy, fair, and wise is she;
      </p>
      <p>
        The heaven such grace did lend her
      </p>
      <p>
        That she might admired be.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <br /> Julia tried not to hear the rest, but these two lines somehow
      thundered into her mind--
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then to Silvia let us sing;
      </p>
      <p>
        She excels each mortal thing.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <br /> Then Proteus thought Silvia excelled Julia; and, since he sang so
      beautifully for all the world to hear, it seemed that he was not only
      false to Julia, but had forgotten her. Yet Julia still loved him. She even
      went to him, and asked to be his page, and Proteus engaged her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, he handed to her the ring which she had given him, and said,
      &ldquo;Sebastian, take that to the Lady Silvia, and say that I should like the
      picture of her she promised me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/verona4.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="outlaws" id="outlaws"></a> Silvia had promised the picture, but she
      disliked Proteus. She was obliged to talk to him because he was high in
      the favor of her father, who thought he pleaded with her on behalf of Sir
      Thurio. Silvia had learned from Valentine that Proteus was pledged to a
      sweetheart in Verona; and when he said tender things to her, she felt that
      he was disloyal in friendship as well as love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia bore the ring to Silvia, but Silvia said, &ldquo;I will not wrong the
      woman who gave it him by wearing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She thanks you,&rdquo; said Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know her, then?&rdquo; said Silvia, and Julia spoke so tenderly of herself
      that Silvia wished that Sebastian would marry Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silvia gave Julia her portrait for Proteus, who would have received it the
      worse for extra touches on the nose and eyes if Julia had not made up her
      mind that she was as pretty as Silvia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon there was an uproar in the palace. Silvia had fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was certain that her intention was to join the exiled Valentine,
      and he was not wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without delay he started in pursuit, with Sir Thurio, Proteus, and some
      servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The members of the pursuing party got separated, and Proteus and Julia (in
      her page's dress) were by themselves when they saw Silvia, who had been
      taken prisoner by outlaws and was now being led to their Captain. Proteus
      rescued her, and then said, &ldquo;I have saved you from death; give me one kind
      look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O misery, to be helped by you!&rdquo; cried Silvia. &ldquo;I would rather be a lion's
      breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julia was silent, but cheerful. Proteus was so much annoyed with Silvia
      that he threatened her, and seized her by the waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O heaven!&rdquo; cried Silvia.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant there was a noise of crackling branches. Valentine came
      crashing through the Mantuan forest to the rescue of his beloved. Julia
      feared he would slay Proteus, and hurried to help her false lover. But he
      struck no blow, he only said, &ldquo;Proteus, I am sorry I must never trust you
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereat Proteus felt his guilt, and fell on his knees, saying, &ldquo;Forgive
      me! I grieve! I suffer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are my friend once more,&rdquo; said the generous Valentine. &ldquo;If
      Silvia, that is lost to me, will look on you with favor, I promise that I
      will stand aside and bless you both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were terrible to Julia, and she swooned. Valentine revived
      her, and said, &ldquo;What was the matter, boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remembered,&rdquo; fibbed Julia, &ldquo;that I was charged to give a ring to the
      Lady Silvia, and that I did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, give it to me,&rdquo; said Proteus.
    </p>
    <p>
      She handed him a ring, but it was the ring that Proteus gave to Julia
      before he left Verona.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proteus looked at her hand, and crimsoned to the roots of his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I changed my shape when you changed your mind,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I love you again,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then outlaws entered, bringing two prizes--the Duke and Sir Thurio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forbear!&rdquo; cried Valentine, sternly. &ldquo;The Duke is sacred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thurio exclaimed, &ldquo;There's Silvia; she's mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Touch her, and you die!&rdquo; said Valentine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be a fool to risk anything for her,&rdquo; said Sir Thurio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are base,&rdquo; said the Duke. &ldquo;Valentine, you are a brave man. Your
      banishment is over. I recall you. You may marry Silvia. You deserve her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank your Grace,&rdquo; said Valentine, deeply moved, &ldquo;and yet must ask you
      one more boon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grant it,&rdquo; said the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon these men, your Grace, and give them employment. They are better
      than their calling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pardon them and you,&rdquo; said the Duke. &ldquo;Their work henceforth shall be
      for wages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What think you of this page, your Grace?&rdquo; asked Valentine, indicating
      Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke glanced at her, and said, &ldquo;I think the boy has grace in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More grace than boy, say I,&rdquo; laughed Valentine, and the only punishment
      which Proteus had to bear for his treacheries against love and friendship
      was the recital in his presence of the adventures of Julia-Sebastian of
      Verona.

    <h2>
      <a name="well" id="well">ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> In the year thirteen hundred and something, the Countess of
      Rousillon was unhappy in her palace near the Pyrenees. She had lost her
      husband, and the King of France had summoned her son Bertram to Paris,
      hundreds of miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram was a pretty youth with curling hair, finely arched eyebrows, and
      eyes as keen as a hawk's. He was as proud as ignorance could make him, and
      would lie with a face like truth itself to gain a selfish end. But a
      pretty youth is a pretty youth, and Helena was in love with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena was the daughter of a great doctor who had died in the service of
      the Count of Rousillon. Her sole fortune consisted in a few of her
      father's prescriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Bertram had gone, Helena's forlorn look was noticed by the Countess,
      who told her that she was exactly the same to her as her own child. Tears
      then gathered in Helena's eyes, for she felt that the Countess made
      Bertram seem like a brother whom she could never marry. The Countess
      guessed her secret forthwith, and Helena confessed that Bertram was to her
      as the sun is to the day.

      name="bertram" id="bertram"></a> She hoped, however, to win this sun by
      earning the gratitude of the King of France, who suffered from a lingering
      illness, which made him lame. The great doctors attached to the Court
      despaired of curing him, but Helena had confidence in a prescription which
      her father had used with success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking an affectionate leave of the Countess, she went to Paris, and was
      allowed to see the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very polite, but it was plain he thought her a quack. &ldquo;It would not
      become me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to apply to a simple maiden for the relief which all
      the learned doctors cannot give me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven uses weak instruments sometimes,&rdquo; said Helena, and she declared
      that she would forfeit her life if she failed to make him well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you succeed?&rdquo; questioned the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will ask your Majesty to give me for a husband the man whom I
      choose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So earnest a young lady could not be resisted forever by a suffering king.
      Helena, therefore, became the King's doctor, and in two days the royal
      cripple could skip.
    </p>
    <p>
      He summoned his courtiers, and they made a glittering throng in the throne
      room of his palace. Well might the country girl have been dazzled, and
      seen a dozen husbands worth dreaming of among the handsome young noblemen
      before her. But her eyes only wandered till they found Bertram. Then she
      went up to him, and said, &ldquo;I dare not say I take you, but I am yours!&rdquo;
       Raising her voice that the King might hear, she added, &ldquo;This is the Man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;take her; she's your wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife, my liege?&rdquo; said Bertram. &ldquo;I beg your Majesty to permit me to
      choose a wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Bertram, what she has done for your King?&rdquo; asked the
      monarch, who had treated Bertram like a son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your Majesty,&rdquo; replied Bertram; &ldquo;but why should I marry a girl who
      owes her breeding to my father's charity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You disdain her for lacking a title, but I can give her a title,&rdquo; said
      the King; and as he looked at the sulky youth a thought came to him, and
      he added, &ldquo;Strange that you think so much of blood when you could not
      distinguish your own from a beggar's if you saw them mixed together in a
      bowl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot love her,&rdquo; asserted Bertram; and Helena said gently, &ldquo;Urge him
      not, your Majesty. I am glad to have cured my King for my country's sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My honor requires that scornful boy's obedience,&rdquo; said the King.
      &ldquo;Bertram, make up your mind to this. You marry this lady, of whom you are
      so unworthy, or you learn how a king can hate. Your answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram bowed low and said, &ldquo;Your Majesty has ennobled the lady by your
      interest in her. I submit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take her by the hand,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;and tell her she is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/well2.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="king" id="king"></a> Bertram obeyed, and with little delay he was
      married to Helena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fear of the King, however, could not make him a lover. Ridicule helped to
      sour him. A base soldier named Parolles told him to his face that now he
      had a &ldquo;kicky-wicky&rdquo; his business was not to fight but to stay at home.
      &ldquo;Kicky-wicky&rdquo; was only a silly epithet for a wife, but it made Bertram
      feel he could not bear having a wife, and that he must go to the war in
      Italy, though the King had forbidden him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena he ordered to take leave of the King and return to Rousillon,
      giving her letters for his mother and herself. He then rode off, bidding
      her a cold good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the letter addressed to herself, and read, &ldquo;When you can get
      the ring from my finger you can call me husband, but against that 'when' I
      write 'never.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dry-eyed had Helena been when she entered the King's presence and said
      farewell, but he was uneasy on her account, and gave her a ring from his
      own finger, saying, &ldquo;If you send this to me, I shall know you are in
      trouble, and help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not show him Bertram's letter to his wife; it would have made him
      wish to kill the truant Count; but she went back to Rousillon and handed
      her mother-in-law the second letter. It was short and bitter. &ldquo;I have run
      away,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;If the world be broad enough, I will be always far away
      from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; said the noble widow to the deserted wife. &ldquo;I wash his name
      out of my blood, and you alone are my child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Dowager Countess, however, was still mother enough to Bertram to lay
      the blame of his conduct on Parolles, whom she called &ldquo;a very tainted
      fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helena did not stay long at Rousillon. She clad herself as a pilgrim, and,
      leaving a letter for her mother-in-law, secretly set out for Florence.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering that city she inquired of a woman the way to the Pilgrims'
      House of Rest, but the woman begged &ldquo;the holy pilgrim&rdquo; to lodge with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena found that her hostess was a widow, who had a beautiful daughter
      named Diana.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Diana heard that Helena came from France, she said, &ldquo;A countryman of
      yours, Count Rousillon, has done worthy service for Florence.&rdquo; But after a
      time, Diana had something to tell which was not at all worthy of Helena's
      husband. Bertram was making love to Diana. He did not hide the fact that
      he was married, but Diana heard from Parolles that his wife was not worth
      caring for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow was anxious for Diana's sake, and Helena decided to inform her
      that she was the Countess Rousillon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He keeps asking Diana for a lock of her hair,&rdquo; said the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helena smiled mournfully, for her hair was as fine as Diana's and of the
      same color. Then an idea struck her, and she said, &ldquo;Take this purse of
      gold for yourself. I will give Diana three thousand crowns if she will
      help me to carry out this plan. Let her promise to give a lock of her hair
      to my husband if he will give her the ring which he wears on his finger.
      It is an ancestral ring. Five Counts of Rousillon have worn it, yet he
      will yield it up for a lock of your daughter's hair. Let your daughter
      insist that he shall cut the lock of hair from her in a dark room, and
      agree in advance that she shall not speak a single word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The widow listened attentively, with the purse of gold in her lap. She
      said at last, &ldquo;I consent, if Diana is willing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana was willing, and, strange to say, the prospect of cutting off a lock
      of hair from a silent girl in a dark room was so pleasing to Bertram that
      he handed Diana his ring, and was told when to follow her into the dark
      room. At the time appointed he came with a sharp knife, and felt a sweet
      face touch his as he cut off the lock of hair, and he left the room
      satisfied, like a man who is filled with renown, and on his finger was a
      ring which the girl in the dark room had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war was nearly over, but one of its concluding chapters taught Bertram
      that the soldier who had been impudent enough to call Helena his
      &ldquo;kicky-wicky&rdquo; was far less courageous than a wife. Parolles was such a
      boaster, and so fond of trimings to his clothes, that the French officers
      played him a trick to discover what he was made of. He had lost his drum,
      and had said that he would regain it unless he was killed in the attempt.
      His attempt was a very poor one, and he was inventing the story of a
      heroic failure, when he was surrounded and disarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/well3.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="letter" id="letter"></a> &ldquo;Portotartarossa,&rdquo; said a French lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What horrible lingo is this?&rdquo; thought Parolles, who had been blindfolded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's calling for the tortures,&rdquo; said a French man, affecting to act as
      interpreter. &ldquo;What will you say without 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much,&rdquo; replied Parolles, &ldquo;as I could possibly say if you pinched me
      like a pasty.&rdquo; He was as good as his word. He told them how many there
      were in each regiment of the Florentine army, and he refreshed them with
      spicy anecdotes of the officers commanding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram was present, and heard a letter read, in which Parolles told Diana
      that he was a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is your devoted friend,&rdquo; said a French lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a cat to me now,&rdquo; said Bertram, who detested our hearthrug pets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parolles was finally let go, but henceforth he felt like a sneak, and was
      not addicted to boasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now return to France with Helena, who had spread a report of her death,
      which was conveyed to the Dowager Countess at Rousillon by Lafeu, a lord
      who wished to marry his daughter Magdalen to Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King mourned for Helena, but he approved of the marriage proposed for
      Bertram, and paid a visit to Rousillon in order to see it accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His great offense is dead,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let Bertram approach me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Bertram, scarred in the cheek, knelt before his Sovereign, and said
      that if he had not loved Lafeu's daughter before he married Helena, he
      would have prized his wife, whom he now loved when it was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love that is late offends the Great Sender,&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;Forget sweet
      Helena, and give a ring to Magdalen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram immediately gave a ring to Lafeu, who said indignantly, &ldquo;It's
      Helena's!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not!&rdquo; said Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon the King asked to look at the ring, and said, &ldquo;This is the ring I
      gave to Helena, and bade her send to me if ever she needed help. So you
      had the cunning to get from her what could help her most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram denied again that the ring was Helena's, but even his mother said
      it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; exclaimed the King. &ldquo;Seize him, guards!&rdquo; but even while they
      were seizing him, Bertram wondered how the ring, which he thought Diana
      had given him, came to be so like Helena's. A gentleman now entered,
      craving permission to deliver a petition to the King. It was a petition
      signed Diana Capilet, and it begged that the King would order Bertram to
      marry her whom he had deserted after winning her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/well4.gif" alt="Please keep photo with html"  /> <a
      name="widow" id="widow"></a> &ldquo;I'd sooner buy a son-in-law at a fair than
      take Bertram now,&rdquo; said Lafeu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admit the petitioner,&rdquo; said the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram found himself confronted by Diana and her mother. He denied that
      Diana had any claim on him, and spoke of her as though her life was spent
      in the gutter. But she asked him what sort of gentlewoman it was to whom
      he gave, as to her he gave, the ring of his ancestors now missing from his
      finger?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram was ready to sink into the earth, but fate had one crowning
      generosity reserved for him. Helena entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I see reality?&rdquo; asked the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O pardon! pardon!&rdquo; cried Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held up his ancestral ring. &ldquo;Now that I have this,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;will
      you love me, Bertram?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the end of my life,&rdquo; cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My eyes smell onions,&rdquo; said Lafeu. Tears for Helena were twinkling in
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King praised Diana when he was fully informed by that not very shy
      young lady of the meaning of her conduct. For Helena's sake she had wished
      to expose Bertram's meanness, not only to the King, but to himself. His
      pride was now in shreds, and it is believed that he made a husband of some
      sort after all.

      <br /> ADVICE TO A SON LEAVING HOME.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor any unproportioned thought his act
    </p>
    <p>
      Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.

    </p>
    <p>
      Grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel;
    </p>
    <p>
      But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    </p>
    <p>
      Of each new-hatched, unfledged comrade. Beware
    </p>
    <p>
      Of entrance to a quarrel: but, being in,
    </p>
    <p>
      Bear it, that the opposer may beware of thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment,
    </p>
    <p>
      Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    </p>
    <p>
      But not expressed in fancy: rich, not gaudy:
    </p>
    <p>
      For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
    </p>
    <p>
      And they in France, of the best rank and station,
    </p>
    <p>
      Are most select and generous, chief in that.

    <p>
      Neither a borrower, nor a lender be:
    </p>
    <p>
      For loan oft loses both itself and friend;
    </p>
    <p>
      And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.

    <p>
      it droppeth, as the gentle rain from heaven,
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;
    </p>
    <p>
      It blesses him that gives, and him that takes:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
    </p>
    <p>
      The throned monarch better than his crown:
    </p>
    <p>
      His scepter shows the force of temporal power,
    </p>
    <p>
      The attribute to awe and majesty,
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
    </p>
    <p>
      But mercy is above this sceptered sway;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is enthroned in the hearts of kings;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an attribute to God himself;
    </p>
    <p>
      And earthly power doth then show likest God's,
    </p>
    <p>
      When mercy seasons justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider this,--
    </p>
    <p>
      That, in the course of justice, none of us
    </p>
    <p>
      Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;

    <p>
      And that same prayer doth teach us all to render

      The deeds of mercy.

      and heard others praise, and that highly,--
    </p>
    <p>
      not to speak it profanely, that,

      neither having the accent of Christians,
    </p>
    <p>
      nor the gait of Christian, Pagan, nor man,
    </p>
    <p>
      have so strutted, and bellowed,

      had made men and not made them well,

      they imitated humanity so abominably.

    </p>
    <p>
      If to do were as easy as to know what were good
    </p>
    <p>
      to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men's
    </p>
    <p>
      cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
    </p>
    <p>
      follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
    </p>
    <p>
      twenty what were good to be done, than be one of
    </p>
    <p>
      twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
    </p>

    <p>
      Princes have but their titles for their glories,
    </p>
    <p>
      An outward honor for an inward toil;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, for unfelt imaginations,
    </p>
    <p>
      They often feel a world of restless cares:
    </p>
    <p>
      So that, between their titles, and low name,
    </p>
    <p>
      There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
